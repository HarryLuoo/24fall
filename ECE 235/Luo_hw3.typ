+ Show that the wave funciton $Psi(x,t) = A sin (k x - omega t)$ does not satisfy the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.
+ Show that $Psi(x,t) = A cos( k x - omega t)$ + iA sin(k x - omega t) satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

A particle is in a infinit spalar well of width $L$. Calculate the ground-state energy if:
+ The particle is a protomo and $L = 0.1$ nm. a typical size for a molecule;
+ the particle is a proton and $L = 1$fm, a typical size for a nucleus.

The wavelength of light emitted by a ruby laser is $694.3$nm. Assuming that the emission of a photon of this wavelength accompanies the transition of an electro from the $n=2$ level to the $n=1$ level of an infinite square well, compute $L$ for the well.

Compute the expectation value of the x component of the momentum of a particle of mass $m$ in the $n=3$ level of a one-dimensional infinite infinite square well of width $L$. Reconcile your answer with the fact that the kinetic energy of the particle in this level is $9 pi^2 hbar^2 slash 2 m L^2$

Find $sigma_x = sqrt( expectationvalue(x^2) - expectationvalue(x)^2 ), sigma_p = sqrt( expectationvalue(p^2)- expectationvalue(p)^2  )$ and $sigma_x sigma_p$ for the ground-state wave function of an infinite square well. Use the fact that $ expectationvalue(p) =0$ by symmetry and $ expectationvalue(p^2)= expectationvalue(2m E)$ from problem 6-31

# Comprehensive Review of Semiconductor Physics

## Part I: Fundamental Band Theory and Material Classification

### 1. Energy Bands and Material Properties

The electronic properties of solids are fundamentally determined by their band structure. The key distinguishing feature is the energy gap and band filling:

#### 1.1 Material Classification
1. **Insulators**
   - Characterized by a full valence band
   - Large energy gap (several eV)
   - No readily available higher energy states
   - Thermal excitation insufficient for conduction
   - Example: Diamond with $$E_{gap} \approx 5.5 \text{ eV}$$

2. **Semiconductors**
   - Behave as insulators at T = 0K
   - Small energy gap ($$\approx 1 \text{ eV}$$)
   - Silicon: $$E_{gap} \approx 1.1 \text{ eV}$$
   - Temperature-dependent conductivity
   - Both electrons and holes contribute to conduction
   
3. **Metals**
   - Partially filled band structure
   - Available states near Fermi level
   - High conductivity even at T = 0K
   - Conductivity decreases with temperature

### 2. Semiconductor Band Structure

#### 2.1 Key Energy Levels
- Conduction Band Edge: $$E_C$$
- Valence Band Edge: $$E_V$$
- Band Gap: $$E_g = E_C - E_V$$
- Fermi Level: $$E_F$$

#### 2.2 Temperature Effects
- Band gap typically decreases with temperature
- Carrier concentration increases with temperature
- Mobility typically decreases with temperature

## Part II: Carrier Statistics and Distribution Functions

### 1. Fermi-Dirac Statistics

#### 1.1 Fermi-Dirac Distribution Function
The probability of electron occupation at energy E:

$$f(E) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(E-E_F)/kT}}$$

Key characteristics:
- At T = 0K: Step function
- At E = EF: $$f(E) = \frac{1}{2}$$
- Temperature causes distribution "smearing"

#### 1.2 Important Cases
For E >> EF:
$$f(E) \approx 0$$

For E << EF:
$$f(E) \approx 1$$

At E = EF:
$$f(E_F) = \frac{1}{2}$$

### 2. Carrier Concentrations

#### 2.1 Electron Concentration
In the conduction band:

$$n = N_C e^{-(E_C-E_F)/kT}$$

where effective density of states:

$$N_C = 2(\frac{2\pi m_e^* kT}{h^2})^{3/2}$$

#### 2.2 Hole Concentration
In the valence band:

$$p = N_V e^{-(E_F-E_V)/kT}$$

where:

$$N_V = 2(\frac{2\pi m_h^* kT}{h^2})^{3/2}$$

#### 2.3 Intrinsic Carrier Concentration
$$n_i = \sqrt{N_C N_V} e^{-E_g/2kT}$$

## Part III: PN Junction Physics

### 1. Built-in Potential

#### 1.1 Formation of Built-in Potential
When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined:

$$V_{bi} = \frac{kT}{q}\ln(\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2})$$

#### 1.2 Depletion Region
Width of depletion region:

$$W = \sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_s}{q}(\frac{N_A + N_D}{N_A N_D})(V_{bi} - V_a)}$$

### 2. Current Components

#### 2.1 Drift Current
Due to electric field:

$$J_{drift,n} = qn\mu_n\mathcal{E}$$
$$J_{drift,p} = qp\mu_p\mathcal{E}$$

#### 2.2 Diffusion Current
Due to concentration gradients:

$$J_{diff,n} = qD_n\frac{dn}{dx}$$
$$J_{diff,p} = -qD_p\frac{dp}{dx}$$

## Part IV: Carrier Transport and Device Operation

### 1. Transport Equations

#### 1.1 Einstein Relation
Connecting diffusion and mobility:

$$D_n = \frac{kT}{q}\mu_n$$
$$D_p = \frac{kT}{q}\mu_p$$

#### 1.2 Diffusion Length
For minority carriers:

$$L_n = \sqrt{D_n\tau_n}$$
$$L_p = \sqrt{D_p\tau_p}$$

### 2. Device Operation

#### 2.1 Forward Bias
Current equation:

$$I = I_s(e^{V_a/V_T} - 1)$$

where:

$$I_s = qA(\frac{D_p p_{n0}}{L_p} + \frac{D_n n_{p0}}{L_n})$$

#### 2.2 Reverse Bias
- Increased depletion width
- Small reverse saturation current
- Breakdown considerations

### 3. Continuity Equations
For electrons:

$$\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = G_n - R_n + \frac{1}{q}\nabla \cdot J_n$$

For holes:

$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = G_p - R_p - \frac{1}{q}\nabla \cdot J_p$$

## Part V: Advanced Topics and Applications

#### 1.1 Direct Recombination
- Band-to-band transitions
- Radiative processes
- Temperature dependence

#### 1.2 Indirect Recombination
- Through traps or defects
- Shockley-Read-Hall statistics
- Impact on device performance

### 2. Device Applications

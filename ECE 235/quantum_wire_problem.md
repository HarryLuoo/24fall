# Electron in a One-Dimensional Infinite Well

An electron moving in a thin metal wire is a reasonable approximation of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite well. The potential inside the wire is constant on average but rises sharply at each end. We'll consider a wire 1.0cm long.

## (a) Ground State Energy

The ground state energy for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite well is given by:

$E_1 = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$

Where:
- $h$ is Planck's constant: $6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Jâ‹…s}$
- $m$ is the mass of an electron: $9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$
- $L$ is the length of the wire: $1.0 \text{ cm} = 0.01 \text{ m}$

Substituting these values:

$E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \times (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times (0.01)^2}$

$E_1 = 6.033 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}$

To convert this to electron volts (eV), we divide by the charge of an electron ($1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$):

$E_1 = 0.377 \text{ eV}$

## (b) Probability of Finding the Electron

The probability of finding the electron in a very narrow region $\Delta x = 0.01L$ wide centered at $x = 5L/8$ can be calculated using the probability density function for the ground state wavefunction.

The ground state wavefunction for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite well is:

$\psi_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin(\frac{\pi x}{L})$

The probability density is the square of the wavefunction:

$|\psi_1(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{\pi x}{L})$

To find the probability, we need to integrate this over the small region:

$P = \int_{5L/8 - 0.005L}^{5L/8 + 0.005L} \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{\pi x}{L}) dx$

For a very narrow region, we can approximate this integral by multiplying the probability density at the center point by the width of the region:

$P \approx \frac{2}{L} \sin^2(\frac{5\pi}{8}) \times 0.01L$

$P = 2 \times 0.01 \times \sin^2(\frac{5\pi}{8})$

$P = 0.02 \times 0.8536$

$P = 0.01707$

Therefore, the probability of finding the electron in this narrow region is approximately 1.71%.

This solution demonstrates the completion of the problem, showing the calculations for both the ground state energy and the probability of finding the electron in the specified region.

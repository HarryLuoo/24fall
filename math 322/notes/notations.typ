The following notations are used in this note:
== Partial Derivatives
The partial derivative of a multivariate function $u(x,t)$ with respect to $t$  can be represented as: 
$ 
    partial_t u = (diff u )/(diff t) =u_t
$ 
For a second derivative,$ 
    partial^2_t u = (diff^2 u)/(diff x^2)  = u_(t t)
$

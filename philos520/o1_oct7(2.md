Modelling the Deep Past
Adrian Currie (0000–0003–2638-202X)
Abstract
The sciences of the deep past use models not only to inform us about actual history, but 
possibility as well. Most philosophical analyses of paleoscientific knowledge focus on ‘tracebased reasoning’: inferences are drawn from observations of ‘traces’ (for instance, fossils) to 
the past, in virtue of background theory concerning how traces form. Such accounts have 
trouble accommodating the ubiquity of modeling practices in these sciences. Models are vital
because access to past actuality requires knowledge of past possibility, and models grant this. 
Furthermore, historical scientists often adopt ‘phenomena-driven’ modelling strategies in 
which models are in intimate dialogue with the historical record. This serves to ensure that the 
possibilities explored are relevant to the investigation at hand.
1. Introduction
Paleoscientists adopt ‘methodologically omnivorous’ strategies to mitigate the epistemic scarcity generated by 
millions of years of information decay. This chapter focuses on one set of those strategies: the use of models to 
understand the deep past. Standard philosophical accounts of historical science fail to capture the importance and 
role of modelling, examining why and how such scientists use models is revelatory of both their methods and the 
nature of knowledge in the paleosciences.
Knowledge of the past is built upon knowledge of possibility, flirting with the idea that the historical sciences are 
less about temporality than about modality. Contra accounts of modelling that emphasize the independence of 
models from empirical data; many models of the deep past are intimately connected to historical evidence. This 
2
‘phenomena-driven’ modelling strategy ensures the possibilities the models explore are relevant possibilities.
Models in the paleosciences are tools for understanding what is (or was) possible.
Section 2 discusses some preliminaries: characterizing ‘trace-based’ accounts of historical reasoning, sketching an 
account of modelling practice, and touring philosophical work on modelling in the paleosciences. In Section 3, two 
examples are introduced: the application of ecological models to Ediacaran ecosystems, and robotics to dinosaur 
aquatic propulsion. In Section 4, the role of model-explored possibility for understanding the past is explored, before 
the conclusion in Section 5.
2. Models & Traces
This section zeroes in on a (non-technical) dilemma: many accounts of paleoscientific reasoning de-emphasize
modelling, yet models are ubiquitous in paleoscience. This suggests the nature of that reasoning should be rethought,
as well as the place of modelling within it.
2.1. Trace-based reasoning
How do we know anything about the deep past? Past events, entities, and processes have reach into the present, that 
is, they sometimes leave traces. The bodies of long-dead organisms, as well as their tracks and burrows, fossilize, 
and they live on via descendants and environmental effects. If we understand processes of preservation and have a 
good grip on, say, fossilization processes, then we can infer from traces to the past. Trace-based reasoning, then, 
involves (1) a set of traces, (2) a set of theories about trace formation together enabling (3) inferences to past states
of affairs (Currie 2018a, chaps. 3–5; Currie 2019a). This inferential strategy forms the foundation of many 
philosophical accounts of historical scientific method.
Carol Cleland’s account is grounded in trace-based reasoning (Cleland 2002; 2011; 2013). For her, proto-typical 
historical science (as opposed to experimental science) distinctively proceeds via smoking gun reasoning. This 
involves, first, identifying a set of surprising correlations between present observations, second, generating a set of 
hypotheses about the past which, if true, would explain those correlations, and third, searching for further traces 
which, if found, would discriminate between those hypotheses. In smoking gun reasoning, historical scientists 
navigate between diverse traces in order to develop and test common-cause explanations (see also Tucker’s 
3
treatments: 2004; 2011, and Kleinhans et al.: 2005; 2010). Forber & Griffith (2011) develop a similar view, 
emphasizing independent evidential convergence. By these accounts, historical reasoning begins and ends with the 
discovery, analysis, and inferential use of, traces
Derek Turner’s defense of anti-realism is also grounded in trace-based reasoning (Turner 2004; 2005; 2007; 2009a). 
Turner argues that, compared to experimental science, knowledge of the deep past is systematically 
underdetermined. That is, traces will be insufficient to discriminate between many past hypotheses. First, historical 
background knowledge(s) provides councils of despair, that is, information destruction is characteristic of history: 
traces decay. Second, unlike in experimental cases, our incapacity to intervene in the past leaves us unable to 
mitigate information loss. Therefore, Turner’s arguments concern trace-based reasoning’s lack of power.
Although much recent philosophical analysis of paleoscience has expanded our conception beyond trace-based 
reasoning1 (see below), suffice to say, it is still (perhaps rightly) central to our conceptions. However, that picture
does not seem to leave room for the surrogative reasoning characteristic of modelling.
2.2. Modelling as strategy
As this volume attests, philosophers of science have been much concerned with models, characterizing them and 
their role in science, asking what models are and how they might be revelatory of nature. I will follow one strand of 
this literature which tackles models not via their content (being idealized, say), but in terms of a particular scientific 
strategy. This account serves as a useful contrast for how historical scientists often use models.
What counts as a model? Both Michael Weisberg and Peter Godfrey-Smith have answered by asking us not to look 
at the features of the model itself, but rather at how models are developed and the use scientists put them to
(Weisberg 2007; Godfrey-Smith 2006). At base, they understand modelling as a kind of indirect strategy: rather than 
looking at our target system or systems, we examine some model system.
Weisberg captures the modeller’s strategy by distinguishing it from what he calls abstract direct representation, or 
ADR. In ADR, we build a representation via the use of empirical data generated from our target system. By contrast, 
the modeller’s strategy takes inspiration from a target system or phenomena, constructing a comparatively
transparent, easy-to-manipulate-and-study proxy, investigating that, and then comparing it to the phenomenon 
downstream. A classic set of studies from the dawn of the ‘paleontological revolution’ illustrates the modeller’s 
strategy applied to the deep past.
4
From the mid-1960s, paleontology became paleobiology, that is, paleontologists began answering a richer set of 
questions concerning extinct organisms (Sepkoski and Ruse 2009). One crucial aspect of this involved interrogating
large-scale macroevolutionary patterns. By careful analysis of typically invertebrate fossils, paleontologists were 
able to infer paleontological phenomena from large data sets. Perhaps the most well-known of these are patterns of 
mass extinction (Raup and Sepkoski 1982; Dresow 2021; Bocchi et al. forthcoming). Raup and Sepkoski use careful 
collation and analysis, characterise a pattern of ‘spikes’ in extinction across deep time: periods when against a 
background extinction rate, improbably large numbers of taxa disappear. An abstract representation is come to 
directly, in Weisberg’s terms, if they infer from the data to the relevant phenomenon.
The availability of invertebrate data sets enabled paleontologists to characterise various large-scale patterns of life: 
radiation, speciation, extinction, and so forth. These patterns raised further questions concerning their underlying
processes: do evolutionary events occur via gradual increments; does speciation require geographic separation; is 
natural selection required to explain mass extinctions, radiations, and other macroevolutionary events? One way of 
tackling these questions involves an indirect strategy, that is, model building.
In the early 1970s, a group of scientists meeting at Woods Hole Marine Biology Lab developed a computer program
designed to simulate large-scale evolutionary patterns. This model eventually become known as the “MBL” model
(Raup et al. 1973; Huss 2009; Turner 2011, 60–64,). At its most simple, the MBL model is extraordinarily so.
Beginning with a single lineage, at each time step it can: split into two lineages (speciate), remain as it is, or go 
extinct. By running the simulation over multiple time steps, and re-running these, the MBL group hoped to generate 
qualitatively similar patterns seen in the record. The model was stochastic: the probability of each event occurring 
had equal probability (with an equilibrium measure added to stop the phylogeny number from exploding beyond 
computational capacity). These probabilities can be manipulated, and deterministic elements added as required. 
Crucially, the stochastic model does not include fitness: there is no feature of a lineage itself, nor external influence,
that makes a difference to its chances of speciating, surviving, or becoming extinct. As such, Raup et al. took the 
model as a way of asking: what macroevolutionary patterns or events require fitness to generate them? The strategy 
was to use the simple model as a kind of baseline with which to identify those macro-evolutionary events which 
required more complexity to model:
If it appears, for example, that a given evolutionary event (such as a mass extinction) cannot 
be simulated by the simple random model, we will abandon certain of the stochastic elements 
5
in favor of additional deterministic constraints. The power of the model will then be its ability 
to specify the minimum departure from randomness necessary to produce a satisfactory replica 
of the real world situation.
(Raup et al. 1973, 527)
For our purposes, the initial MBL model illustrates the modeller’s strategy according to Weisberg’s account. As he
summarizes:
In the first stage, a theorist constructs a model. In the second, she analyzes, refines, and further 
articulates the properties and dynamics of the model. Finally, in the third stage, she assesses 
the relationship between the model and the world if such an assessment is appropriate. If the 
model is sufficiently similar to the world, then the analysis of the model is also, indirectly, an 
analysis of the properties of the real-world phenomenon. Hence, modeling involves indirect 
representation and analysis of real-world phenomena.
(Weisberg 2007, 209–210)
Raup et al. (1973) began by building a single stochastic branching model. They then examined 
the model’s parameters, investigating which patterns emerged, and which deterministic elements 
were required to generate other patterns. Only after this process did they explicitly consider the 
relationship between model and macroevolutionary pattern.
Thus, we can understand modelling as a kind of scientific strategy involving the indirect representation of a target 
system. Instead of sticking to the phenomena, modellers take a step back, constructing and investigating a relevantly 
similar proxy. This is only one way of understanding models: there are scientific tools and representations that 
philosophers and scientists call ‘models’ which are much more intimately concerned with data. For instance, models 
are very often used in inferences from data sets to patterns and phenomena, and indeed representations of those 
phenomena might rightly be considered ‘data-models’ (Suppes 1966; Leonelli 2019; Antoniou 2021). The point of 
6
introducing this particular account is as a contrast: as will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4, modelling in 
paleontology is often phenomena-led in a way that differs from the strategy identified here.
2.3. The philosophy of paleoscientific modelling
Many philosophers have emphasized the role of models in the sciences of the deep past (see Bokulich and Oreskes 
2017 for a systematic tour focused on geoscience, Sepkoski 2012 for an insightful discussion of paleobiological 
models). Some of that work is sketched below.
Philosophers have responded to Cleland’s trace-centric account by appealing to the use of models in the historical 
sciences. Derek Turner, for instance, highlights the use of computer simulations in estimating gaits in long-extinct 
therapods (Turner 2009b). Functional morphologists build models representing an animal’s maximal speed and gait 
based on its anatomical properties. These simulations are tested on living analogues and, based on fossil 
reconstructions, generate gait and speed by running iterative competitions between varying gaits, where variations 
are generated from the best performers to form the basis of the next bout. I have pointed to the use of simple 
geometric models to explore and test models of long-extinct echinoderm development (Currie 2018a, chap. 9). With 
very simple assumptions, paleontologists are able to generate geometric forms very similar to those seen in 
echinoderm fossils, and these results were put to work in exploring differences between early and late echinoderm 
development.
Functional morphology provides many examples of modelling strategies, which philosophers have discussed. Like 
Turner, I appealed to gait simulations, providing an analysis of how models and simulations might provide 
surprising results (Currie 2018b). In this case, an exploration of sauropod gait, simulations suggested that sauropods 
walked with a gait unseen—novel and surprising—in extant animals. Marco Tamborini explores the use of robotic 
models—in a sense, concrete versions of the in silico examples Turner and I examine—to emphasize the 
entanglement of technology and nature in historical reasoning (Tamborini 2020; 2021).
Alison Wylie has argued that archaeology should be understood as a fundamentally model-based discipline, 
suggesting understanding “…archaeological practice as a genre of empirically grounded, investigative reasoning 
with and through models” (2017a, 3). Adopting a broad conception of models, Wylie includes abstract 
characterizations of assemblage patterns (e.g., the use of ‘Clovis’ arrow-heads to identify cultural spread across the 
Americas); models representing patterns in spatial distribution (e.g., the positioning and orientation of grave goods);
7
chronological models representing the appearance and disappearance of assemblages, as well as various models 
from related fields (carbon dating, ethnographies, etc.). Often models in archaeology guide interpretation and aid in 
understanding the various forces, which form and transform the archaeological record—thus crucial for trace-based 
reasoning—see also Nyrup (2020). Wylie also covers models closer to the modelling strategy identified above.
Wylie discusses computational models of subsistence activities, such as Flannery and Richard’s (1986) simulation of 
agricultural spread based on data from Gila Naquitz cave. Simulation runs begin by evolving a diverse set of 
foraging activities, followed by the introduction of agricultural strategies. The model aimed to distinguish between 
hypotheses concerning what drove the emergence of agriculture and includes parameters aimed at capturing features 
revealed in actual data. Wylie argues that such models work as ‘scaffolding’ for various archaeological 
interpretations: they provision interpretations and their results drive further tests (see also Routledge 2021). This 
involves, as she notes, navigating between understanding ‘how actually’ and ‘how possibly’—a feature emphasized
downstream.
Modelling work also plays a crucial role in re-integrating and re-using old (or ‘legacy’) data. Both Wylie (2017b) 
and I (Currie 2021a) have emphasized how modelling strategies can aid in the resurrection of apparently lost data, 
and in bringing old data into renewed contact with up-to-date evidence and questions. As such, modelling is a way 
of bringing data into contact with hypotheses about the past beyond the discovery of new traces.
Like its neontological cousin, paleoclimatology relies on a combination of empirical measurements and oftencomplex coupled computational systems that represent factors such as global temperature, albedo, ice-pack 
coverage, continental positions, and so forth. I have appealed to simulation studies of Snowball Earth to defend the 
notion of a ‘surrogate experiment’ and to suggest that idealisation strategies in the historical sciences are geared 
towards representing phenomena at the right grain for trace data to be relevant (Currie 2018b, chap. 10). Wilson and
Boudinot (2022) highlight the use of vicarious controls, particularly highly localised models of measurement 
processes, to make sense of the diversity of proxy measurements paleoclimatology relies upon.
Alisa Bokulich discusses the use of models to make sense of historical data, describing how models correct and 
represent fossil data in estimating biodiversity. This grounds further exploration of the nature of data models more 
generally (Bokulich 2021a). Expectations about biodiversity, represented by models, are brought into dialogue with 
data from the fossil record both to correct for the latter’s (infamous) unreliability—often through vicarious post-hoc 
modelling work—but also to further refine the former. Bokulich also appeals to conceptual and table-top models 
8
representing the dynamics of river channels to explore how the ‘tyranny of scales’ is navigated in the geosciences
(Bokulich 2021b). In brief, variations between conceptual and concrete models—sometimes inconsistent ones!—are 
used to identify threshold effects across scales and to tailor various models towards specific purposes.
Modeling is ubiquitous in historical science and is plausibly crucial for historical scientists to mitigate epistemic 
scarcity. This suggests that accounts of historical reasoning that emphasize trace-based reasoning misapprehend both 
historical method and its epistemic prowess.
3. Two Models of the Deep Past
This section introduces two case studies. Each is picked to emphasize particular features of historical reasoning,
which enrich our picture of the strategies historical scientists pursue.
3.1. Dinosaur Tails
The first model consists of a set of.93 millimetre thick pieces of plastic, laser-cut into similar shapes and (scaled) 
proportions as the tails of various reptiles, including small therapods, extant newts, crocodiles, and the study’s 
central topic, Spinosaurus, the largest therapod dinosaur known. These ‘tails’ are attached to a robotic controller that 
can generate left-to-right or up-and-down movement, and submerged in a water flume. As the plastic waggles in the 
flume, Ibrahim et al. (2020) are able to calculate the tails’ thrust and efficiency:
Our experimental results show that the Spinosaurus tail shape was capable of generating more 
than 8 times the thrust of the tail shapes of other theropods, and achieved 2.6 times the 
efficiency. 
(Ibrahim et al. 2020, 69)
Ibrahim et al. draw on the results to argue the Spinosaurus was an aquatic pursuit predator. That is, the dinosaur 
used to hunt aquatic prey by, well, chasing them:
9
[…] the vertically expanded tail shape of Spinosaurus imparts a substantial positive benefit to 
aquatic propulsion relative to the long and narrow tails of terrestrial theropods, supporting the 
inference that Spinosaurus used tail-propelled swimming. (69)
In 2005, the same paleontological team discovered a remarkably complete specimen of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. 
Their 2014 report (Ibrahim et al. 2014) recounted careful extraction and a functional morphological analysis in favor
of S. aegyptiacus being semi- or fully aquatic. The long snout, for instance, is reminiscent of piscivores, while the 
reduced hindlimbs (compared to bipedal therapods) suggested unusual motion. These conclusions led to a flurry of 
objections (e.g., Hone and Holtz 2021, Brusatte 2021). In their 2020 paper, Ibrahim et al. respond, focusing on the 
tail.
In addition to the model, Ibrahim et al. defend their morphological reconstruction. They argue that the disarticulated 
fossil remains came from the same individual and provide a more detailed reconstruction of the tail. For instance, 
where standard theropods have stiff tails, providing balance for bipedal stances, S. aegyptiacus’ was much more 
flexible, suggesting to Ibrahim et al. that the tail’s morphology “… allowed it to function as a propulsive structure 
for aquatic locomotion” (69). Ibrahim et al.’s model was constructed as a way of testing a hypothesis: could in fact
the tail produce the relevant thrust required by the specified function? They think yes.
3.2. Avalonian Ecological Communities
Our second model consists of a Spatial Point Process Analysis (SPPA), a set of equations that compare the spatial 
distribution of a set of objects to a stochastic null. These statistical analyses start from the notion of a point process
or field, a collection of randomly assigned locations across a Euclidean space. By generating a set of randomly 
assigned locations (where the probability of a location being occupied is equal), we can generate a kind of 
reference—a spatially random distribution—against which various non-random distributions can be compared. In 
ecological contexts, Euclidean space is taken to represent—you guessed it—physical space, and the points are 
interpreted as taxa or ecotype locations.
By comparing the actual distribution of taxa to the random distribution generated by the model, ecologists determine 
whether that distribution can be understood stochastically (where taxa placement is independent) or whether there 
are further factors determining the spatial pattern. The stochastic distribution acts as a pseudo-null, and to the extent 
10
that actual spatial distribution diverges from it, the more that spatial distribution is non-stochastic2. Mitchell et al.
(2019) make use of SPPA to examine whether ecosystems are structured according to niche 
(deterministic/predictable) or neutral (stochastic) processes.
Most ecological systems are structured by niche: competition for resources leads to different species living in 
different environments or niches, which explains the spatial distribution of differing taxa. This niche model can be
compared to neutral structures, where taxa are distributed stochastically. If we know the spatial distribution of a set 
of immobile taxa in an ecosystem, we can use a model to generate a null, basically, the kind of distribution to be
expected if taxa did not compete. By comparing the actual distribution to the null, it can be determined whether taxa 
are distributed neutrally or by niche differentiation. Mitchell et al. use the model to analyse the oldest metazoan
ecosystems.
Metazoan life arose in the Ediacaran approximately 575 million years ago (Narbonne 2005, Liu, Kenchington, and
Mitchell 2015). Its earliest are the Avalonian assemblages found in Newfoundland and the UK, a series of sessile, 
benthic communities. These are dominated by rangeomorphs, frond-like creatures attached to the seafloor (of 
unknown metabolic, developmental, phylogenetic, and ecological status), and a thick, leathery microbial mat coating 
the seafloor. These assemblages were fossilised via volcaniclastic events and, due to the properties of the mat, and 
the lack of large, complex, mobile life, in situ position was likely preserved. Thus, we have the closest we can hope 
to of a census community: a snapshot of the various taxa and their spatial locations. If Mitchell and company can 
work out taxa membership, then, SPPA can be undertaken.
Mitchell and her team used laser-line probe technology to scan fossil beds (Mitchell and Butterfield 2018). This data 
was used to produce spatial and taxonomic data models that formed the basis of the distribution analysis. Mitchell et 
al. claim that the analysis provides “… strong evidence that neutral process dominated Avalonian assemblage 
communities” (Mitchell and Butterfield 2018; Mitchell 2022). As SPPA is also used to study extant ecosystems, the 
model enables the comparison of Avalonian paleocommunities to communities from other times, places, and 
ecological makeup:
These neutral-process-dominated community dynamics contrast with those observed in the 
modern marine realm, where neutral processes are typically rare […] This stark difference 
11
raises the question of whether Ediacaran early animal paleocommunities had fundamentally 
different community dynamics […] to those of the present day.
(Mitchell et al. 2019, 2034)
This point of difference potentially holds between Avalonian and Phanerozoic communities, Jackson and Blois 
(2015), for instance, found niche-structured communities in the Quaternary. What could explain this stark 
difference? Mitchell et al. point to a set of further differences, suggesting that conditions of the Avalonian limited 
the development of the dynamics that underwrite niche differentiation:
The studied Ediacaran paleocommunities have comparatively small populations, experienced 
frequent disturbance events, and include many taxa with short dispersal ranges, so within this 
framework we should expect neutral processes to dominate. (2035)
Additionally, Mitchell et al. emphasize that resource limitations were significantly fewer in the Avalonian. Thus, 
they argue, given the relevant conditions, Avalonian communities do not challenge our ideas of how ecosystem 
structure should work. As opposed to fundamentally differing community dynamics, the same basic set of dynamics 
structure these communities the differences being due to the (ecologically) impoverished conditions of the 
Avalonian.
4. Modality & Modelling in Historical Science
We are now in a position to provide a positive characterization of the role of models in historical reasoning. First, 
models are crucial for historical science because understanding possibility is crucial for historical science. Second,
the ‘phenomena-driven’ strategy often adopted by historical scientists differs somewhat from the modelling strategy
identified by Weisberg and Godfrey-Smith. While both involve surrogative approaches, the phenomena-driven 
modelling strategy is in deep conversation with historical data and phenomena.
4.1. Possible Pasts
Historical science is as much about what is possible—what may have happened—as what actually happened. Even 
when historical scientists are primarily interested in understanding the actual past, this requires a rich understanding 
12
of possibility. We get to the actual by situating our data within possibility. First, trace-based reasoning requires an 
understanding of the regularities by which traces form (Jeffares 2008). Second, tests of hypotheses about the past do 
not only involve hunting for further traces, but also confirming capacity-hypotheses. Can certain kinds of structures 
in fact behave as posited—as seen in Ibrahim et al.’s robotic dinosaur tail? Third, the application of models across 
temporal contexts allows us to confirm and test more general regularities—as we see in the application of ecological 
models to the Avalonian.
The initial argument that Spinosaurus is an underwater pursuit predator leant on functional morphology and 
analogy. Some of Spinosaurus’ morphological traits plausibly indicate a partially aquatic lifestyle, and others are 
common amongst fish-eaters. Such evidence, when coming from multiple sources, can make a strong case. 
However, it does not speak directly to particular capacities. For instance, the hypothesis is presaged on the idea that
Spinosaurus could swim fast. This does not directly concern whether in fact it did: this is not a question of actuality, 
but a question of capacity or possibility.
Ibrahim et al. are reasonably well understood as performing a Kon-Tiki Experiment, named for Thor Heyerdahl’s 
voyages from South America to the Pacific (Novick et al. 2020). Heyerdahl sought to prove possible his preferred 
hypothesis for Pacific migrations: from the West via drift voyaging. Although his hypothesis has been rightly 
rejected, as the Pacific was purposefully settled from the East via extremely sophisticated navigational knowledge 
and technology (Holton 2004), it is plausible that his journey proved that drift voyaging from the Americas to the 
Pacific is possible. Ibrahim et al.’s experiment similarly seek to show that a tail like Spinosaurus’ could produce a 
significant amount of propulsion, at least compared to other large therapods. This establishes possibility, but not 
actuality.
How does establishing possibility aid Ibrahim et al.? It does not in itself establish that Spinosaurus was capable of 
fast underwater pursuit: these animals were not disembodied tails, but enormous carnivorous dinosaurs with great 
big sails on their backs. Rather, the various tail experiments explore a particular possibility space, one concerning 
various tail morphologies (or at least various plastic proxies of tail morphology) and their ability to produce 
underwater propulsion. The model departs from the real world:
Some limitations of this study are the simplicity of the robotic structure design (i.e. a flat 
plastic tail profile mounted on an undulating rack) and the fact that motion, although set to an 
13
amplitude and speed informed by living undulatory swimmers (salamanders of the genus 
Amblystoma and the American alligator) did not account for specific anatomical constraints 
(i.e., vertebral motion ranges, flexibility, muscle configuration).
(Gutarra and Rahman 2022, 20)
To make sense of the capacity hypothesis concerning the tail, it must be contextualised together with other features 
of Spinosaurus. The modal space must then be integrated into a larger picture of the animal (see Currie 2019b).
Ibrahim et al.’s study, then, can be understood as a test of the aquatic-pursuit hypothesis: had it rendered a negative 
result—if the tail could not support sufficient propulsion—then the aquatic-pursuit picture would be seriously 
undermined. However, the model goes further: it also provides crucial modal information about the relationship 
between tail morphology and aquatic propulsion.
Mitchell et al.’s work is not plausibly considered a Kon-Tiki experiment—they are not testing for some capacity 
required by some hypothesis—however, their application of SPPA models goes beyond inferring the neutrality of 
Avalonian metazoan communities. They also situate those communities in comparison to others and use it as a test 
case for the generality of the ecological regularities underlying SPPA models. Thus, past instances are used to 
establish regularities (Page 2021). As we saw above, the surprising neutrality-dominated ecosystems of the 
Avalonian raised the possibility that they obeyed ‘fundamentally different dynamics’, as Mitchell et al. put it. The 
model’s predictions were a kind of anomaly: either ecosystems were different in the Ediacaran such that the model 
does not apply, or the model is getting it right and we need to explain its results further.
Mitchell et al. opt for the latter: once we take Avalonian conditions into account, our usual understanding of 
ecological communities will expect neutrality. Pointing to factors such as a lack of ecological maturity, resource 
competition, dispersal, etc., and comparing the Avalonian to analogues under similar conditions (which do tend 
towards neutrality), they show how the anomalous case fits within our understanding of ecosystems after all:
While the dominance of neutral processes within these paleocommunities differs substantively 
from the majority of the modern marine realm, the underlying dynamics are entirely consistent 
with models of assembly which include both niche and neutral processes, and are similar to 
those of modern communities subject to the same conditions.
14
(Mitchell et al. 2019, 2015)
While some philosophers—Cleland in particular—have argued that historical scientists are primarily interested in 
understanding the token, actual past (Cleland 2011), others have denied this on several fronts—and we see these in 
both of our modelling examples. First, trace-based reasoning relies crucially on regularities about how traces form 
(Jeffares 2008). Second, reconstructions of the past require an understanding of the various capacities posited in 
hypotheses about the past. If Spinosaurus was an underwater pursuit predator, it must have been capable of aquatic 
pursuit. Third, as Page (2021) has compellingly argued, sometimes the past is the key to the future: models of 
regularities can be tested, refined, and confirmed against the historical record. In addition, historical investigation is 
often interested in ‘fragile regularities’ (Currie 2018a, chap. 7), regularities which only hold, often imperfectly, 
under certain conditions. With care, Mitchell et al. are able to further understand the ecological regularities SPPA
models explore—their fragilities, and indeed how they might potentially work into the future—via their application 
to the past.
Therefore, historical sciences are not simply sciences of the past, but sciences of modality. Models are well suited
for representing, exploring, and testing the contours of modal spaces. This concern with the possible explains the 
ubiquity of modelling practices in the historical sciences.
4.2. Phenomena-Driven Modelling
Many scientific pursuits, particularly theoretical ones, can be understood as exercises in possibility exploration. 
Indeed, philosophers have long recognized the critical importance of modal knowledge for prediction, explanation,
and understanding. However, paleoscience often explores possibility in a particular way: in intimate dialogue with 
historical data. Ibrahim et al.’s proxy exploration of thrust generated by pieces of plastic are constructed in light of, 
and justified through, comparisons with reconstructions of extinct organisms. Mitchell et al.’s use of SPPA requires 
complex data analysis and careful application to the Avalonian context. These modelling pursuits can be 
characterised as phenomena-driven (as opposed to theory-driven) investigations, and two things follow. First, it 
implies a different modelling strategy to that identified by Weisberg and Godfrey-Smith. Second, it helps us 
understand how fossil and other data ensure the relevance of the possibilities that historical scientists examine.
15
Many model-based sciences are theory-driven (Currie 2019b). In theory-driven investigation, the relevance of 
evidence is determined by the relationship between data and the target theory. Although many investigations of the 
deep past concern theories—Mitchell et al. for instance are interested in, explore, and employ ecological theories 
about community spatial composition and its relationship to the dynamics of those communities—they proceed 
primarily through the identification, articulation and explanation of particular empirical phenomenon (Dresow 
2021). In phenomena-driven investigations, evidential relevance is determined by the phenomenon at hand. Mitchell 
et al. do not explore ecological community dynamics via further model-based explorations. The models they 
employ, how they employ them, and what they conclude are intimately tied to phenomena they use the model to 
identify: the neutral structure of Avalonian communities. An extraordinary amount of effort goes into characterizing 
these communities, including data collection, analysis, and application.
A major difference between modelling in theory-driven versus phenomenon-driven contexts concerns relevance. All 
modelling practices explore possibility, but what are these modal spaces good for? In particular, for what are they 
relevant? In theory-driven contexts (some contenders being game-theoretic and signalling models seeking to 
understand the emergence of co-operation, language, multi-cellularity, and so on) the distance between modelling 
results—as sophisticated and fascinating as they might be—and the real past, is potentially minimal (Currie and 
Sterelny 2017). There is little constraint provided by actual instances of the historical phenomena these modelling 
activities are supposed to speak to. Moreover, when actual history is brought into discussion, theoretical models are 
often shown to be barking up the wrong modal trees. Overall, models best understand the actual past when in 
intimate dialogue with evidence pertaining to that past and that dialogue reassures us that the possibility spaces 
examined are of relevance to the phenomenon of interest.
Phenomena-driven modelling differs from the strategy described by Weisberg. There, modelers take inspiration 
from natural phenomena, build, and examine a model capturing the basic contours of the phenomenon; eventually
comparing modelling results to the original phenomena. In building the MBL model—at least at first—Raup et al.
were interested in how patterns, qualitatively similar to those in the fossil record, could be generated in a highly 
simple, abstract, ‘bare-bones’ system. Phenomena-driven modelling is significantly more iterative, as features of the 
model are continually checked against the relevant properties of the phenomena in question. Ibrahim et al. are not
simply interested in differences in broad tail-shape as captured by pieces of plastic, but go to some lengths to 
demonstrate that the relative proportions match the fossil reconstructions in relevant ways. The model does not
16
afford an indirect strategy for the understanding of theory in the abstract, but is tailor-made in accordance with 
specific features of empirical data towards exploring highly specific questions.
In phenomena-driven modelling, idealisation is a tool that enables both tractability and relevance. For Mitchell et al., 
the spatial and taxic information that was retrievable from Avalonian deposits afforded the application of SPPA 
models. While for Ibrahim et al., a model needed to be constructed matching the specifics of the epistemic situation, 
that is, one that captured sufficiently the relevant features of therapod tails while also being amenable to 
experimentally establishing the relevant capacities. That models may be idealised and de-idealised to fit various 
levels of description is crucial for phenomena-driven modelling: with much care, modelers can ensure their 
representational tools are at the right grain for the available data to be relevant to them (see Currie 2018a, chap. 10).
5. Conclusion
Scientists interested in what was are just as interested in what could have been. Reconstructing token past events 
requires situating them in possibility space, past patterns and events are powerful sources of modal knowledge. 
Models are, if nothing else, tools for understanding modality: they explore possibility (Bokulich 2014; Massimi 
2019; Knuuttila 2021; Wirling and Grüne‐Yanoff 2021). Thus, the prevalence of modelling practices in the sciences 
of the deep past is no surprise. Nevertheless, historical scientists are not interested in any-old possibility: past 
phenomena guide their exploration, ensuring relevance. In such work, then, modelling practices are intimately 
concerned with, and are in iterative contact with, historical data. Knowing the deep past requires modelling the deep 
past.

# Comprehensive Notes on "Modelling the Deep Past" by Adrian Currie

## **Overview**
Adrian Currie's chapter "Modelling the Deep Past" explores the pivotal role of models in paleoscientific research. The chapter critiques traditional philosophical accounts that prioritize trace-based reasoning, arguing that such perspectives inadequately capture the ubiquity and significance of modeling practices in understanding the deep past. Currie posits that models are essential not only for inferring historical events but also for exploring possible scenarios, thereby bridging the gap between what is known and what could have been.

## **Abstract**
- **Key Argument**: Traditional philosophical analyses focus on trace-based reasoning, which is insufficient to account for the widespread use of models in paleosciences.
- **Modeling's Role**: Models are crucial for accessing not just actual historical events but also their possibilities.
- **Phenomena-Driven Modeling**: Historical scientists often engage in modeling strategies that are closely tied to empirical data, ensuring the exploration of relevant possibilities.

## **1. Introduction**
- **Epistemic Scarcity**: Paleoscientists face challenges due to the vast temporal scales and information decay, leading them to adopt diverse strategies to mitigate knowledge gaps.
- **Focus on Models**: The chapter centers on the use of models, arguing that understanding the deep past relies significantly on modeling practices that go beyond mere trace analysis.
- **Historical Sciences and Modality**: Knowledge of the past intertwines with knowledge of what could have happened, emphasizing the modal (possibility-related) aspects of historical sciences.

## **2. Models & Traces**

### **2.1. Trace-Based Reasoning**
- **Definition**: Inferences about the past drawn from observed traces (e.g., fossils) using background theories about trace formation.
- **Framework**:
  1. **Set of Traces**: Physical evidence from the past.
  2. **Theories of Trace Formation**: Understanding how these traces were created.
  3. **Inferences to Past States**: Drawing conclusions about historical events or entities based on traces and theories.
- **Philosophical Accounts**: 
  - **Carol Cleland**: Emphasizes 'smoking gun' reasoning, involving surprising correlations, hypothesis generation, and trace-based discrimination.
  - **Derek Turner**: Advocates an anti-realist stance, highlighting the underdetermination in historical sciences due to trace decay and lack of interventionist capabilities.

### **2.2. Modelling as Strategy**
- **Philosophical Views**:
  - **Weisberg & Godfrey-Smith**: Define models based on their development and usage rather than their intrinsic features, viewing modeling as an indirect strategy to understand target systems.
  - **Modeller’s Strategy**: Involves constructing a proxy model inspired by the target system, analyzing it, and comparing outcomes to the actual phenomenon.
- **Case Study**: 
  - **MBL Model**: A stochastic branching model developed to simulate large-scale evolutionary patterns, serving as a baseline to identify complexities beyond randomness in macroevolutionary events.
- **Contrast with Phenomena-Driven Modeling**: Traditional modeling strategies are more abstract, while phenomena-driven approaches are closely intertwined with empirical data.

### **2.3. Philosophy of Paleoscientific Modeling**
- **Modeling in Various Disciplines**:
  - **Functional Morphology**: Uses simulations to infer locomotion or other functional aspects of extinct organisms (e.g., Spinosaurus' swimming capabilities).
  - **Archaeology**: Models guide interpretation and understanding of cultural spread, subsistence activities, and the resurrection of legacy data.
  - **Paleoclimatology**: Employs complex computational models to represent and understand climatic factors in Earth's deep past.
- **Philosophical Insights**:
  - Models serve as tools to correct and refine fossil data, navigate scale differences, and integrate old data with new evidence.
  - Emphasis on models as epistemic artifacts that facilitate the understanding of both actual and possible historical scenarios.

# Comprehensive Summary of "Modelling the Deep Past" by Adrian Currie

## **Introduction**

In "Modelling the Deep Past," Adrian Currie delves into the intricate methodologies employed by paleoscientists to reconstruct and understand Earth's extensive history. Currie critically examines the prevailing philosophical frameworks that prioritize trace-based reasoning—inferring past events from observable remnants like fossils—and argues that these frameworks inadequately account for the pervasive and essential role of modeling in paleoscientific endeavors. He posits that models are not merely supplementary tools but are fundamental to piecing together both the actualities and possibilities of the deep past, thereby bridging gaps imposed by the vast temporal scales and the inevitable decay of information over millions of years.

## **Abstract**

Currie's central thesis challenges traditional philosophical analyses that predominantly focus on trace-based reasoning within paleosciences. He asserts that such accounts fail to encapsulate the critical and ubiquitous role of modeling practices. Models, according to Currie, are indispensable not only for inferring historical facts but also for exploring potential scenarios, thus facilitating a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the past. He introduces the concept of "phenomena-driven" modeling, where models are intricately linked with empirical data, ensuring that the possibilities they explore are directly relevant to the specific historical investigations at hand.

## **1. Introduction**

Currie begins by highlighting the epistemic challenges faced by paleoscientists, primarily the scarcity of information due to the immense timescales involved and the consequent decay of evidence. To mitigate these challenges, paleoscientists adopt "methodologically omnivorous" strategies, employing a diverse array of methods to extract knowledge from limited and often degraded data. Among these strategies, the use of models stands out as particularly crucial. Traditional philosophical accounts, which emphasize trace-based reasoning—drawing inferences from fossilized remains and other traces—are critiqued for overlooking the integral role of modeling. Currie contends that historical sciences like paleontology are less about temporal sequences and more about modality, meaning they frequently engage with what could have been, not just what was.

## **2. Models & Traces**

### **2.1. Trace-Based Reasoning**

Trace-based reasoning involves making inferences about past events, entities, and processes based on observable traces such as fossils, tracks, and burrows. This method relies heavily on background theories that explain how these traces form. For instance, understanding the processes of fossilization allows scientists to infer the existence and characteristics of extinct organisms. Philosophers like Carol Cleland have framed historical science as primarily employing "smoking gun" reasoning, where surprising correlations between present observations lead to hypotheses about the past, which are then tested by seeking further traces. Derek Turner, advocating an anti-realist perspective, argues that trace-based reasoning in historical sciences is fundamentally underdetermined due to the decay of traces and the inability to intervene in the past, leading to significant gaps in knowledge.

### **2.2. Modelling as Strategy**

Currie shifts the focus to modeling as a strategic scientific practice. Philosophers such as Michael Weisberg and Peter Godfrey-Smith define models based on their development and usage rather than their intrinsic features, viewing them as indirect strategies to understand target systems. Weisberg introduces the distinction between "abstract direct representation" (ADR), where models directly represent phenomena using empirical data, and the modeller’s strategy, which involves creating simplified, manipulable proxies inspired by the target system to explore and understand its dynamics.

A pivotal case study illustrating this is the MBL (Macroevolutionary Branching Lineage) model developed in the 1970s. This stochastic branching model simulates evolutionary patterns by allowing lineages to speciate, remain unchanged, or go extinct at each time step with equal probability. By manipulating probabilities and introducing deterministic elements, paleontologists like Raup and Sepkoski used the MBL model to identify macroevolutionary events that could not be explained by randomness alone, thereby pinpointing the necessity of more complex processes like natural selection.

### **2.3. Philosophy of Paleoscientific Modeling**

Currie surveys various philosophical contributions that emphasize the role of models in historical sciences. Functional morphology, for example, employs simulations to infer locomotive capabilities of extinct animals, such as determining whether Spinosaurus was adapted for aquatic pursuit. Archaeology uses models to interpret cultural spread and subsistence activities, often integrating legacy data with new evidence through model-based approaches. Paleoclimatology leverages complex computational models to represent climatic factors, aiding in the reconstruction of Earth's climatic history.

Philosophers have highlighted how models in these disciplines serve multiple functions: they correct and refine fossil data, navigate scale differences, and integrate old data with contemporary evidence. Currie underscores that models act as epistemic artifacts, facilitating the understanding of both actual historical events and their possible variations, thereby enhancing the robustness of historical reconstructions.

## **3. Two Models of the Deep Past**

Currie presents two detailed case studies to illustrate the application and significance of modeling in paleoscientific research.

### **3.1. Dinosaur Tails**

The first case study examines the work of Ibrahim et al. (2020), who investigated the locomotion of Spinosaurus, the largest known theropod dinosaur. By creating physical models of various theropod tails, including that of Spinosaurus, and testing their propulsion efficiency in water, they aimed to determine whether Spinosaurus was adapted for aquatic pursuit. The experiments demonstrated that Spinosaurus' tail could generate significantly more thrust and was more efficient than those of other theropods, supporting the hypothesis that it was adapted for swimming and hunting aquatic prey.

Philosophically, this study exemplifies the "Kon-Tiki Experiment," wherein models are used to test specific capacity hypotheses about extinct organisms. The experiments by Ibrahim et al. establish not only the possibility that Spinosaurus could swim effectively but also provide modal insights into the relationship between tail morphology and aquatic propulsion. This approach underscores how models can probe the capacities and potential behaviors of extinct species, thereby enriching our understanding of their ecology and lifestyle.

### **3.2. Avalonian Ecological Communities**

The second case study focuses on Mitchell et al. (2019), who utilized Spatial Point Process Analysis (SPPA) to study the spatial distribution of Ediacaran taxa in Avalonian assemblages. SPPA compares the actual spatial distribution of taxa with a stochastic null model to determine whether the distribution is neutral (stochastic) or structured by ecological niches (deterministic processes). The findings indicated that Avalonian communities were predominantly structured by neutral processes, a stark contrast to modern marine ecosystems typically governed by niche differentiation.

This study illustrates how modeling can be employed to test ecological regularities and understand community dynamics in the deep past. By situating Avalonian communities within the framework of SPPA, Mitchell et al. were able to explore whether the observed spatial patterns could arise purely by chance or required underlying ecological processes. Their conclusion—that neutral processes dominated—challenges existing ecological theories and prompts further investigation into the unique conditions of Ediacaran ecosystems. This exemplifies the phenomena-driven approach, where models are directly informed and constrained by empirical observations, ensuring their relevance and applicability to the specific historical phenomena under study.

## **4. Modality & Modeling in Historical Science**

### **4.1. Possible Pasts**

Currie emphasizes that historical sciences are inherently concerned with both the actual and the possible past. Understanding what could have happened is as crucial as knowing what did happen, as it allows scientists to reconstruct events within a broader context of possibilities. Models play a critical role in this process by exploring capacity hypotheses and testing regularities that underpin historical narratives.

For instance, the study on Spinosaurus' tail by Ibrahim et al. not only supports the actual scenario of aquatic pursuit but also delineates the range of possible locomotion capabilities based on tail morphology. Similarly, the SPPA approach used by Mitchell et al. explores the range of possible ecological configurations, thereby enriching the understanding of Avalonian communities beyond mere trace analysis.

### **4.2. Phenomena-Driven Modeling**

Currie introduces the concept of "phenomena-driven" modeling, which contrasts with traditional, theory-driven modeling approaches. In phenomena-driven modeling, the construction and refinement of models are directly informed by empirical data, ensuring that the exploration of possibilities remains grounded in observed phenomena. This iterative process involves continuous validation and adjustment of models based on empirical findings, enhancing their relevance and accuracy.

In the case studies presented, both Ibrahim et al. and Mitchell et al. exemplify phenomena-driven modeling. Ibrahim et al. tailored their tail models to match fossil reconstructions and empirical constraints, while Mitchell et al. closely aligned their SPPA models with detailed spatial and taxonomic data from Avalonian assemblages. This approach ensures that the models are not abstract explorations of theoretical possibilities but are instead deeply intertwined with the specific empirical contexts they seek to understand.

Currie argues that this phenomena-driven approach necessitates a different modeling strategy than that described by Weisberg and Godfrey-Smith. Instead of building abstract proxies to understand general theories, phenomena-driven models are iteratively refined to align closely with specific empirical data, ensuring that the possibilities they explore are directly relevant to the historical phenomena at hand.

## **5. Conclusion**

Adrian Currie's exploration in "Modelling the Deep Past" underscores the indispensable role of modeling in historical sciences, particularly paleontology. He argues that while trace-based reasoning remains foundational, modeling practices are equally critical for bridging epistemic gaps and exploring the rich landscape of historical possibilities. Models enable paleoscientists to reconstruct not just what existed but also how it might have functioned and interacted within its environment.

Currie advocates for a philosophical reevaluation that moves beyond trace-centric accounts to incorporate the nuanced and pervasive role of modeling in historical reasoning. He highlights the necessity of phenomena-driven modeling, where models are intricately connected with empirical data, ensuring their relevance and enhancing their explanatory power. This approach not only enriches our understanding of the deep past but also reveals the modal dimensions of historical sciences, positioning them as disciplines deeply concerned with both actuality and possibility.

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Integration of Models and Traces**: Traditional trace-based reasoning, while foundational, is insufficient on its own. Models complement trace analysis by exploring and testing possible historical scenarios, thereby providing a more holistic understanding of the past.

2. **Phenomena-Driven Modeling**: This approach ensures that models remain closely tied to empirical data, enhancing their relevance and reliability. It contrasts with more abstract, theory-driven modeling strategies by emphasizing iterative refinement based on specific historical phenomena.

3. **Modal Dimensions of Historical Science**: Historical sciences like paleontology engage deeply with modality—what could have happened—not just temporality—what did happen. Models are essential tools for navigating this modal landscape, enabling scientists to reconstruct and understand a wide array of possible historical narratives.

4. **Philosophical Implications**: Currie's work calls for philosophical frameworks to expand beyond trace-based reasoning, recognizing the crucial and multifaceted role of modeling in historical sciences. This expansion can lead to more accurate and comprehensive accounts of scientific methodologies and epistemologies in disciplines concerned with the deep past.

## **Implications for Future Research**

Currie's analysis invites a broader philosophical engagement with the methodologies of historical sciences. Future research could focus on developing more sophisticated philosophical models that fully integrate the role of modeling in historical reasoning. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaborations between philosophers and paleoscientists could yield deeper insights into how models are constructed, validated, and utilized to interpret the deep past. Methodological innovations in modeling techniques, particularly those that better integrate empirical data with theoretical explorations of possibility, could further enhance the robustness and accuracy of historical reconstructions.

as a curious student in the philosophy of sciences, what questions would you ask Currie after reading this paper? explain your motivation behind the questions as well

---

As a curious student in the philosophy of science engaging with Adrian Currie's "Modelling the Deep Past," several thought-provoking questions emerge. These questions aim to deepen understanding, explore implications, and critically assess the arguments presented in the paper. Below are some potential questions along with the motivations behind them:

---

### **1. How Does Phenomena-Driven Modeling Integrate with Traditional Trace-Based Reasoning?**

**_Motivation:_**  
Currie emphasizes the importance of phenomena-driven modeling as a complementary strategy to trace-based reasoning. Understanding how these two approaches interact can illuminate the broader methodology of historical sciences. Specifically, it’s essential to explore whether phenomena-driven models merely supplement trace-based inferences or if they fundamentally alter the epistemic framework by which scientists reconstruct the deep past.

---

### **2. In What Ways Can Models Mitigate the Underdetermination Problem Highlighted by Turner?**

**_Motivation:_**  
Derek Turner argues that historical sciences are inherently underdetermined due to trace decay and the inability to intervene in the past, leading to multiple plausible explanations for limited evidence. Currie posits that modeling practices can bridge epistemic gaps. Investigating how models specifically address underdetermination can clarify whether modeling offers a robust solution to the epistemic challenges in historical sciences or if underdetermination persists despite sophisticated modeling.

---

### **3. To What Extent Does Phenomena-Driven Modeling Affect the Realism vs. Anti-Realism Debate in Historical Sciences?**

**_Motivation:_**  
Currie’s advocacy for models that explore possible scenarios intertwines with debates on scientific realism—whether models represent actual entities and processes in the world—or anti-realism, which might view models as mere instruments. Understanding the philosophical stance Currie takes regarding the ontological status of models can provide insights into how modeling practices influence broader epistemological positions within historical sciences.

---

### **4. How Generalizable are the Case Studies to Other Areas of Historical Science?**

**_Motivation:_**  
Currie illustrates his arguments using case studies from paleontology and ecology, such as the Spinosaurus tail experiments and the Avalonian ecological communities. A pertinent question is whether the phenomena-driven modeling approach he champions is applicable across other historical sciences like geology, archaeology, or paleoclimatology. This inquiry assesses the universality of his claims and explores potential disciplinary variations in modeling practices.

---

### **5. What Are the Limits of Phenomena-Driven Modeling in Addressing Epistemic Scarcity?**

**_Motivation:_**  
While Currie argues that phenomena-driven modeling effectively mitigates epistemic scarcity, it is valuable to probe the boundaries of this approach. Questions arise regarding the extent to which models can compensate for the lack of direct evidence, especially in cases where empirical data are exceptionally sparse or highly ambiguous. Exploring these limits can identify scenarios where even sophisticated models may fall short, thereby refining the scope of Currie’s thesis.

---

### **6. How Do Phenomena-Driven Models Ensure Relevance and Avoid Overfitting to Specific Data?**

**_Motivation:_**  
Currie highlights that phenomena-driven models maintain relevance by being in intimate dialogue with empirical data. However, this raises concerns about the potential for models to become overly tailored to specific datasets, possibly at the expense of broader applicability or predictive power. Investigating the mechanisms by which models balance specificity with generalizability can shed light on the methodological robustness of phenomena-driven approaches.

---

### **7. Can Phenomena-Driven Modeling Provide Predictive Power, or is it Primarily Explanatory?**

**_Motivation:_**  
While modeling in historical sciences is largely retrospective, it is intriguing to consider whether phenomena-driven models can offer predictive insights about future or undiscovered aspects of the deep past. Understanding whether Currie envisions these models as tools for prediction, explanation, or both can clarify their functional role within scientific practice and their philosophical implications.

---

### **8. How Should Philosophical Frameworks Adapt to Better Incorporate Modeling Practices in Historical Sciences?**

**_Motivation:_**  
Currie calls for philosophical accounts of historical reasoning to expand beyond trace-based reasoning to include the nuanced role of modeling. This prompts questions about the specific changes or additions needed in philosophical frameworks to accommodate these practices. Exploring this can help in developing more comprehensive theories of scientific methodology that accurately reflect the practices of historical sciences.

---

### **Conclusion**

These questions aim to engage deeply with Currie’s arguments, exploring their implications, limitations, and broader connections within the philosophy of science. They encourage a critical examination of how modeling practices reshape our understanding of historical reasoning and the epistemic foundations of the sciences concerned with the deep past.

### **Can Phenomenon-Oriented Modeling Offer Predictive Power, or Is It Primarily Explanatory?**

**_Extended Motivation and Context:_**

Adrian Currie's examination of "phenomenon-driven" modeling in "Modeling the Deep Past" raises a central question in the philosophy of science: **Do these models possess predictive capabilities, or are they essentially explanatory tools?** This question is particularly important because Currie views models not only as instruments for reconstructing historical events but also as mechanisms for exploring possible scenarios. The question of whether phenomenon-oriented models extend their utility to prediction or remain limited to explanation has profound implications for both scientific methodology and philosophical interpretations of historical sciences.

**_Currie's Argument and Model Applications:_**

Currie argues that models in historical sciences like paleontology serve a dual purpose. They are indispensable for inferring what **actually happened** and for investigating what **could have happened** - a modality-centered approach. In the case study of Spinosaurus tails (Ibrahim et al., 2020), for example, physical models were used to test hypotheses about the dinosaur's aquatic propulsion capabilities. These models were used not only to **explain** observed morphological features but also to explore the **possible** range of locomotion strategies Spinosaurus might have employed. Similarly, Mitchell et al. (2019) illustrate with their spatial point process analysis (SPPA) for ecological communities in Avalon how models can explain the prevalence of neutral processes in structuring these communities while also pointing to **possible** ecological dynamics that differ from modern analogs.

**_Explanatory vs. Predictive Power:_**

Currie's emphasis on "phenomenon-driven" modeling is closely aligned with an **explanatory framework**. Models are iteratively refined based on empirical data to ensure they remain relevant and accurately reflect the specific historical phenomena being investigated. This iterative refinement enhances their ability to **explain** existing data and understand the underlying processes that shaped the deep past. However, the question arises whether these models are also suitable for **prediction**.

In traditional sciences like physics or meteorology, models are often valued for their **predictive power**, allowing scientists to forecast future events based on established patterns and underlying theories. In contrast, phenomenon-oriented models in historical sciences are primarily **retrospective**. They reconstruct past events and explore possibilities within these reconstructions but typically do not predict future occurrences. For instance, while the Spinosaurus tail model explains how the dinosaur might have functioned in an aquatic environment, it doesn't predict new, future insights about Spinosaurus behavior or morphology.

**_Philosophical Implications:_**

From a philosophical standpoint, this distinction underscores a fundamental difference between historical and experimental sciences. Historical sciences grapple with unique epistemic challenges, such as the inability to conduct controlled experiments and reliance on incomplete, degraded evidence. Currie's work suggests that while phenomenon-oriented models enhance explanatory understanding and fill epistemic gaps, their **predictive power** is inherently limited by the contingent and non-repeatable nature of historical events.

However, one could argue that by thoroughly understanding processes and regularities in the deep past, these models might provide **predictive** hypotheses about similar conditions in unobserved or future contexts. For example, insights gained from Avalon's ecological models might enable predictions about ecosystem responses to similar environmental stresses in the present or other historical periods. This predictive extension, however, is secondary to the primary **explanatory** role Currie attributes to phenomenon-oriented modeling.

**_Conclusion:_**

In summary, phenomenon-oriented modeling in historical sciences, as formulated by Currie, primarily serves an **explanatory** function by reconstructing and understanding past events within a framework of possibilities. While these models increase our explanatory power and epistemic robustness, their predictive capabilities are more constrained compared to models in experimental sciences. This delineation underscores the unique methodological and philosophical landscape of historical sciences, where the interplay between actual and possible past scenarios remains a central theme.

### **Comprehensive Question for Adrian Currie on Predictive Power of Phenomena-Driven Modeling**

**_Context and Motivation:_**

In your chapter "Modelling the Deep Past," you compellingly argue that traditional philosophical accounts of historical sciences, which emphasize trace-based reasoning, fail to fully capture the critical role that models play in paleoscientific research. You introduce the concept of "phenomena-driven" modeling, where models are developed in close dialogue with empirical data to explore both actual historical events and their possible variations. Through case studies such as the analysis of Spinosaurus' tail propulsion (Ibrahim et al., 2020) and the study of Avalonian ecological communities using Spatial Point Process Analysis (Mitchell et al., 2019), you illustrate how these models not only reconstruct past phenomena but also navigate the modal landscape of what could have been.

**_Question:_**

**"In your discussion of phenomena-driven modeling within historical sciences, you emphasize the explanatory and reconstructive functions of models in understanding both the actual and possible past. Building on your case studies of Spinosaurus' aquatic adaptations and Avalonian ecological structures, to what extent do you perceive phenomena-driven models to possess predictive capabilities beyond their primary role in explanation and reconstruction? Specifically, can these models be utilized to generate testable predictions about undiscovered fossils, ecological patterns, or future research directions, thereby extending their utility into the predictive domain? Additionally, how does the potential for predictive power in phenomena-driven modeling align with your thesis that historical sciences are deeply concerned with modality? For instance, do you envision these models facilitating anticipatory hypotheses that guide empirical discoveries, or are they inherently constrained to retrospective analysis due to the nature of historical data? Understanding whether phenomena-driven models can bridge explanation and prediction would significantly enhance our comprehension of their epistemic roles and methodological strengths in reconstructing the deep past."**

**_Rationale Behind the Question:_**

1. **Expanding the Scope of Modeling Functions:** While your chapter thoroughly explores how phenomena-driven models aid in explaining and reconstructing historical scenarios, the question seeks to investigate whether these models also contribute to predictive endeavors. This extension is crucial for understanding the full spectrum of modeling functions in historical sciences.

2. **Integration with Philosophical Themes:** The question ties back to your emphasis on modality—the exploration of possibilities—as central to historical sciences. It probes whether predictive capabilities can coexist with, or even enhance, the modal exploration you advocate.

3. **Case Study Relevance:** By referencing specific case studies (Spinosaurus' tail and Avalonian communities), the question grounds the inquiry in concrete examples from your work, demonstrating a nuanced engagement with your arguments.

4. **Addressing Methodological Implications:** Understanding whether models can predict invites a discussion on the methodological boundaries and potentials of historical sciences, potentially leading to richer philosophical insights about scientific practice in disciplines constrained by non-repeatable historical data.

5. **Encouraging Further Exploration:** This question opens avenues for discussing how predictive modeling could influence future paleoscientific research, fostering a dialogue on the evolution of modeling practices in historical sciences.

**_Conclusion:_**

This comprehensive question aims to deepen the dialogue on the multifaceted roles of models in historical sciences by exploring their potential beyond explanation and reconstruction. It seeks to engage with your core arguments while pushing the boundaries of understanding regarding the predictive capabilities of phenomena-driven modeling, thereby contributing to a more holistic philosophical assessment of modeling practices in paleosciences.

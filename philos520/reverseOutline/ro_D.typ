Uniformitarianism Re-Examined, Max Dresow

== Introduction: Ediacaran Case Study
*A* Sprigg's 1946 Discovery
   - Red sandstone with clay partings, South Australia
   - "Queer markings suggestive of jellyfish"
   - Initially dated as early Cambrian
   - By 1959, confirmed as Precambrian

*B* Evolution of Ediacaran Interpretations
   - Glaessner (1959-61): soft corals, jellyfish, annelids, arthropods
   - Seilacher (1980s): "Vendobionta" - quilted air-mattress forms lacking mouths/guts
   - Modern view: multiple clades, "flashes of familiar biology in unfamiliar combinations"

== Historical Development
*A* Whewell's 1832 Introduction
   - Uniformitarians: nature uniform through ages
   - Catastrophists: directional history with major paroxysms
   - Alps formation debate: gradual vs catastrophic

*B* Lyell's Influence
   - Merged methodological caution with empirical claims
   - "Ordinary forces and time" preference
   - Created lasting "creative confusion"

== Forms of Understanding
*A* Four Distinct Types:
   1. What happened: descriptive understanding (e.g., Permian extinction timing \<60,000 years)
   2. Why events occurred: causal explanations
   3. Complex earth systems: biological-physical interactions
   4. Geological record: taphonomy, resolution, fidelity

== Core Questions
*A* Necessity Debate
   - Laws of nature stability vs. geological specificity
   - Donaldson's claim: all Precambrian rocks interpretable through present

*B* Non-uniformitarian Applications
   - Alvarez impact hypothesis acceptance
   - Cambrian Explosion debate: standard vs. novel mechanisms

*C* Anthropocene Challenge
   - "Stationarity is dead" (Milly et al. 2008)
   - Unprecedented greenhouse-gas forcing rates
   - Debate over model revision needs

*D* Actualistic Studies Value
   - Live-dead studies showing fine-scale fidelity
   - Chenier studies revealing transgressive ravinement origins
   - Lithification bias in older sediments
   - Taphonomic megabiases requiring correction

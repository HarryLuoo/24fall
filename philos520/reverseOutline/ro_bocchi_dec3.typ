= Biodiversity vs. paleodiversity measurements: \ the incommensurability problem
\

* 1. Introduction* 
- The paper hypothesizes a current biodiversity crisis based on comparing paleodiversity and modern biodiversity.
- Claims it's harder to justify this crisis due to incommensurability between paleodiversity and biodiversity measurements.

* 2. Measuring Biodiversity* 
   - * 2.1 Disclaimer on Measurements* 
      - Terminology and process orientation.
   - * 2.2 Species-Based Measurements* 
      - * Species Richness Index:*  Basic species count measure with limitations (sampling effect, nonlinearity).
      - * Menhinick Species Richness Index:*  Corrects sampling bias but has conceptual issues (normal distribution assumption).
      - * Gini-Simpson Index:*  Measures species richness and evenness but has non-linearity and practical issues.
   - * 2.3 Conceptual Limitations* 
      - Richness and abundance as parts or proxies for biodiversity but not exhaustive measures.
   - * 2.4 Processual Approach* 
      - Phylogenetic systematics operationalizes biodiversity through evolutionary history (Faith’s PD index).

* 3. Measuring Paleodiversity* 
   - * 3.1 Basics* 
      - Paleodiversity tracks macroevolutionary trends using fossil records (Sepkoski’s paleodiversity curve).
   - * 3.2 Methodology* 
      - Two-stage process: Fossil data collection and statistical correction to create paleocurves.
   - * 3.3 Issues in Data* 
      - Incomplete fossil record, biases (differential preservation, sampling), classification issues.

* 4. The Incommensurability Problem* 
   - * Conceptual Incommensurability* 
      - Different frameworks and purposes.
      - Biodiversity as evolutionary process vs. paleodiversity as taxonomic patterns.
   - * Data Incommensurability* 
      - Different taxonomic levels (species vs. genera/families), representation biases.
   - * Implications* 
      - General crisis claims lack strong justification without shared measurement criteria.

* 5. Three Solutions* 
   - * Restructure Paleodiversity:*  Incorporate phylogenetic distance and functionality.
   - * Simplify Biodiversity:*  Operationalize biodiversity closer to taxa counts.
   - * Eliminative Approach (Santana):*  Focus on specific biological values rather than broad biodiversity.

* 6. Conclusion* 
   - Recommends using a more practical approach by focusing on specific biological measures.
   - Argues for more precise conservation strategies based on deconstructed biodiversity values.

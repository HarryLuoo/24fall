// == Comprehensive Notes on "Radiocarbon Dating in Archaeology: Triangulation and Traceability" by Alison Wylie

// ==== *Abstract*
// - Radiocarbon dating (14C dating) revolutionized Archaeology in the 1950s.
// - Initially hoped to replace local, relative chronologies with absolute chronologies.
// - However, 14C dating has faced significant challenges and undergone three revolutions.
// - Introduced principles of *triangulation* and *traceability* key for using radiocarbon data in archaeological contexts.

==== *Section 1: The Quest for an Absolute Chronology*
- Archaeological data are "tragically local" and can be easily detached from their original contexts.
- *Historical Methods:*
  - *19th Century Methods:* Development of techniques for temporal structuring of stratigraphy.
  - *Three Age System:* Cultural sequencing by Thomsen, Nilsson, and Worsaae drew upon geological principles.
  - *Stylistic Seriations:* Extending chronological sequences through the ordered succession of artifacts.
  - Tying chronologies to historical records and physical chronologies (e.g., dendrochronology, varve dating).
  
- *Introduction of Radiocarbon Dating:*
  - Based on the stable decay rate of radioactive carbon isotopes ($$^{14}C$$).
  - Aimed to create chronological frameworks independent of sample context and broader variations.
  - Initial ambition aligned with Latour's notion of “mobile immutable" data.

==== *Section 2: Capturing Radiogenic Data*
- Within a decade, it became clear that technical and practical scaffolding was required for applying 14C dating in archaeology effectively.
- *Challenge 1: Minimizing Contamination:*
  - Establishing field practices tailored for sample recovery and handling to avoid contamination.

- *Challenge 2: Method Refinement:*
  - Development of laboratory protocols for reliable measurement of 14C.
  - Recognition of influences from electromagnetic impurities, radon contamination, ambient radiation among others.
  - Accuracy and precision standards evolved progressively towards end-of 20th century.

==== *Section 3: Calibration: Refinement and Conversion*
- The second revolution involved calibration addressing:
  - Non-uniform atmospheric ratio of $$^{14}C$$ to $$^{12}C$$ and $$^{13}C$$ over time and space.
  - The differential absorption of $$^{14}C$$ by different organisms.
  - Establishing standards was intricate:
    - Correction for "industrial" and "bomb" effects.
    - Comprehensive calibration programs developed, employing extensive background knowledge from various scientific domains.
- Formation and refinement of calibration datasets important for transforming laboratory measures of $$^{14}C$$ to calendar years.

==== *Section 4: Traceability and Triangulation*
- Bayesian chrono-modelling has catalyzed a third major transformation ("Third Radiocarbon Revolution").
- Emphasis on combining radiogenic data with archaeological specifics.
- Methods of “traceability” and “triangulation” reinforce accuracy:
  - *Traceability:* Ensures retrieval and observational data maintain context throughout data creation.
  - *Triangulation:* Cross-referencing with other datasets to verify and correct anomalies; utilizing a variety of information sources.

==== *Section 5: Robustness Reasoning About Temporal Data*
- Robustness reasoning employed to ground temporal claims precisely and counteract confounding effects.
- Application of robustness ensures data reliability—dependent on the context, conceptual rigor, and empirical validation.
- *Woodward's & Norton's Theories:* Essential consideration of empirical, domain-specific assumptions specific to archaeology.

// ==== *Unpacking the Argument:*
// - Data journeys see materials documented, processed, and transitioned into chronological models.
// - Emphasizing the significant "relational" nature of data, tied to practical arguments for determining their credibility.
// - Complex iterative improvements continuously redefine the procedures for capturing, interpreting, and utilizing data in constructing chronologies.

== *Conclusion*
- Extensive, iterative processes underpin the transformation of organic artifacts into usable chronological markers. 
- Coordination amongst different scientific domains to reinforce robustness and reliability.
- Establishing the credibility of interpretations in alignment with the evolving nature of archaeologically relevant temporal data and broader empirical and methodological advancements.

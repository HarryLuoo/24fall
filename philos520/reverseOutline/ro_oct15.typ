=== _When Should Absence of Evidence Be Evidence of Absence? \ A Case Study from Paleogeology_ 
by Matthew Brewer

==== *1. Introduction*
- *Main Idea*: Challenges the aphorism "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" and introduces the need for a nuanced understanding in paleogeology.
- *Example*: Coelacanth fish case, illustrating the pitfalls of equating AoE with EoA.
- *Objective*: Defend the practice of interpreting AoE as EoA in paleosciences.

==== *2. The Probabilistic View and Its Historical Antecedents*
- *Historical Context*: Origins of the phrase in late 19th-century geology.
- *Probabilistic View*: Articulated by Sober and Wallach, AoE is strong EoA only when evidence is highly expected.
- *Limitations*: Inadequate for contexts where evidence is not typically expected, such as paleogeology.

==== *3. Case Study: Absence of Evidence for Plate Tectonics*
- *3.1 Timing the Onset of Plate Tectonics*
  - *Debate*: No consensus on when plate tectonics began, with dates ranging from the Neoproterozoic to the Hadean era.
  - *Key Evidence*: Blueschist, ophiolites, and UHP rocks, which are indicative of plate tectonics.
  - *Interpretations*: Some geologists treat AoE as EoA, while others suggest evidence was destroyed or not produced.
  - *Challenge*: Probabilistic View deems AoE as weak EoA in deep past contexts.

- *3.2 The Pragmatic View*
  - *Introduction*: Treating AoE as EoA is justified by pragmatic benefits.
  - *Theoretical Scaffold*: Enables investigation of auxiliary hypotheses, such as preservation conditions.
  - *Contrastive Testing*: Facilitates testing hypotheses against a range of alternatives.
  - *Encouraging Investigation*: Promotes exploration of why evidence is absent, leading to theoretical advancement.

==== *4. Application to Plate Tectonics*
- *Sternâ€™s Arguments*: Evidence should have been preserved if plate tectonics operated before the Neoproterozoic.
- *Auxiliary Hypotheses*: Investigate preservation conditions and alternative geological processes.
- *Advantages*: Supports comprehensive investigations and richer hypothesis testing, enhancing understanding of Earth's history.

==== *5. Conclusion*
- *Critique of Probabilistic View*: Inadequate for paleogeology where evidence is not typically expected.
- *Advocacy for Pragmatic View*: Balances probabilistic considerations with practical needs, facilitating progress in understanding Earth's history.
- *Implications*: Encourages a nuanced understanding of evidence and inference in the philosophy of science, promoting more refined scientific theories.

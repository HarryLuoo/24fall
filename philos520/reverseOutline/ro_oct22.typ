== Introduction
- *Context*: Challenges the traditional distinction between observation and experiment in philosophy of science.
- *Thesis*: Argues against the epistemic superiority of experiments over observations.
- *Proposal*: Focus on features that crosscut the distinction to better understand scientific methodology.

== Traditional View
- *Historical Definitions*:
  *Herschel*: Observation is passive; experiment is active manipulation.
- *Contemporary Debates*:
  - *Hacking*: Experiments create phenomena; observations detect.
  - *Gooding & Malik*: No clear distinction; both involve interaction.
  - *Perović*: Continuum of manipulability.
- *Currie and Levy*: Emphasize control  as key to experiments’ epistemic privilege.

== Arguments for Epistemic Superiority
- *Definition (ES)*: Superior methods discriminate between more hypotheses.
- *Theses*:
  - *Strong Control*: Only experiments allow fine-grained control.
  - *Strong Causation*: Only experiments allow causal inferences.
- *Weaker Forms*:
  - *CP Control*: Experiments generally allow better control.
  - *CP Causation*: Experiments generally allow better causal inferences.
- *Critique*: Physical manipulation is neither necessary nor sufficient for fine-grained control or causal inference.

== CP Arguments for Epistemic Superiority of Experiment
- *Practical Superiority of Observation*:
  Example: Dian Fossey’s gorilla studies.
- *Confirmatory Power*:
  - *Currie and Levy*: Control leads to better data.
  - *Okasha*: Organized observation can mimic experiments.
  - *Woodward*: Dependency structures in data.
- *Frequency and CP Claims*:
  - Need thorough accounting of natural processes.
  - Ideal experiments vs. ideal observations.
- *Randomization*:
  - RCTs control confounders through random assignment.
  - Observational methods can achieve similar benefits.
- *Causal Inference and Counterfactuals*:
   *Spirtes et al.*: Observational methods can outperform experiments.

== What Does Make Empirical Methods Epistemically Superior
- *Alternative Features*:
  - *Signal Clarity*: Sensitivity and noise reduction.
  - *Characterization of Backgrounds*: Identifying and subtracting irrelevant features.
  - *Discrimination and Variability of Precipitating Conditions*: Understanding conditions that produce signals.
- *Relation to Observation/Experiment Distinction*:
  - Features crosscut the distinction.
  - Physical manipulation is a red herring.
- *Philosophical Payoffs*:
  - Avoids dismissing observational fields.  || Provides deeper understanding of contextual parameters.

== Concluding Remarks
- *Arguments Against Epistemic Superiority of Experiment*:
  - Physical manipulation is not necessary for fine-grained control or causal knowledge.
  - Nuanced arguments fail to support a general claim to epistemic superiority.
- *Shift in Focus*:
  - From observation/experiment distinction to more fine-grained features.
  - More informative for the epistemology of empirical research.

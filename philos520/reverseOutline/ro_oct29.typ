*ABSTRACT*
- Uniformitarianism has two distinct components:
  1. Substantive uniformitarianism: A testable theory claiming uniformity of rates/conditions in geological processes
  2. Methodological uniformitarianism: A principle asserting natural laws remain constant across time and space
- Main argument: Substantive uniformitarianism is false and should be abandoned; methodological uniformitarianism is redundant as it's inherent to all science

*HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT*
=== 19th Century Context:
  - Catastrophists (like Buckland) believed in:
    - Series of major upheavals in Earth's history
    - Divine intervention in geological processes
    - Geology as supporting religious views
  
=== Lyell's Response:
  1. Substantive Uniformitarianism:
     - Proposed gradual change through constant natural processes
     - Argued for uniform rates of geological change
     - Initially denied progression in organic history
  
  2. Methodological Uniformitarianism:
     - Asserted invariability of natural laws
     - Aimed to eliminate supernatural explanations
     - Made geology truly scientific
     
- Important Distinction:
  - These two concepts were related but logically distinct
  - Could have catastrophic theories that reject substantive uniformitarianism while maintaining methodological uniformitarianism

*LATER INTERPRETATION*
- Term "uniformitarianism" coined by Whewell (1832)
- Historical confusion:
  - Some geologists applied term to substantive theory
  - Others used it for methodological principle
- Ongoing debate:
  - Critics attacked substantive theory
  - Defenders upheld methodological principle
  - Much confusion due to single term describing two concepts

*STATUS OF THE CONCEPT*
1. Substantive Uniformitarianism:
   - No longer tenable as strict theory
   - Contradicted by new data (e.g., non-uniform patterns in extinction)
   - Restricts hypothesis formation

2. Methodological Uniformitarianism:
   - Still valid but redundant
   - Not unique to geology
   - Simply represents basic scientific induction
   - Requires two principles:
     a. Spatial/temporal invariance of natural laws
     b. Simplicity principle (use observable causes before theoretical ones)

*CONCLUSION*
- Substantive uniformitarianism: Should be abandoned as incorrect
- Methodological uniformitarianism:
  - Was historically important in establishing geology as science
  - Now redundant as it's equivalent to saying "geology is science"
  - Term should be retired as its historical purpose (combating supernatural explanations) is complete
  - Keeping it risks confusion and false impression of geology having unique scientific principles

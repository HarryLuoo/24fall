The Role of Historical Science in Methodological Actualism, Meghan D. Page

1. Introduction
- Challenge: Historical science traditionally seen as reconstructive, not law-discovering
- Thesis: Historical science is crucial for understanding causal regularities in natural processes
- Context: Debate on uniformitarianism vs. actualism in geology

2. The Irregularity of Historical Science (Literature Review)
- Cleland's view: Distinction between historical (retrospective) and experimental (predictive) science
- Windelband's distinction: Idiographic (event-focused) vs. nomothetic (law-focused) science
- Critiques: Current views fail to recognize historical science's role in discovering regularities

3. Uniformitarianism in Geology
- Historical context: Lyell's principle that the present explains the past
- Problem: Strong uniformitarianism (constant rates) is proven false
- Gould's solution: Distinguish between substantive (process rates) and methodological (law invariance) uniformitarianism
- Key distinction: Methodological uniformitarianism vs. methodological actualism

4. Applied Methodological Actualism
Case Study 1: Ice Core Analysis
- $$Î´^{18}O$$ ratios used to reconstruct temperature history
- Paterson-Clarke technique: Historical data reveals limitations of modern calibrations
- Insight: Historical reconstructions show non-uniform relationships

Case Study 2: Tree Ring Analysis
- Fir tree growth patterns reveal unexpected climate signals
- Historical data shows sensitivity to SO2 emissions
- Insight: Historical data reveals process complexity and conditions affecting growth

5. Broecker's Hypothesis (Extended Case Study)
- Historical temperature records show abrupt changes
- Hypothesis: Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has multiple stable modes
- Evidence: Historical data supports mode switches in AMOC
- Insight: Historical science discovers new causal relationships, impacting future predictions

6. Conclusion
- Historical science tests stability of current processes over time
- Methodological actualism requires historical perspective to understand process variations
- Past variations are crucial for accurate future predictions
- Historical reconstructions act as natural experiments, revealing process boundaries and conditions

Key Methodological Progression:
1. Challenges traditional view of historical science
2. Reviews limitations of existing frameworks
3. Introduces and clarifies methodological distinctions
4. Demonstrates through detailed case studies
5. Shows potential for historical science to discover new causal relationships
6. Establishes a new understanding of the role of historical science in methodological actualism

Main Takeaway: Historical science is not just about explaining the past using known laws; it reveals the limitations of these laws and discovers new causal relationships, serving as natural experiments for understanding complex processes.

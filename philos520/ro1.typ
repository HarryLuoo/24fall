= Introduction
   - Defines parachute science and its ethical problems
   - Outlines paper structure
   - Argues main issue is *distributive justice*
= Criteria for Parachute Science
   - Provides preliminary definition from literature
   - Distinguishes from broader scientific colonialism
   - Lists necessary criteria:
      - Research conducted outside researcher's affiliated country
      - No meaningful collaboration with local researchers
  - Flexible criteria: evidence of non-collaboration
= Case Study: Irritator Challengeri and Harms of Parachute Science
   - Introduces I. challengeri case
   - Three types of harms:
    - Non-reciprocal exploitation of resources
      - Lack of collaboration in research design
      - Lack of involvement during investigation
      - Lack of collaboration in data analysis and publication
    - Loss of knowledge and heritage for local communities
      - Difficulty accessing exported objects
      - Loss of paleontological and cultural heritage
      - Impact on education and diversity in the field
    - Increased likelihood of poor epistemic quality
      - Erosion of trust in science by local communities
      - Missed opportunities for knowledge of future fossil localities
      - Risk of research retraction due to ethical misconduct
= Distributive Epistemic (In)Justice
   - Defines distributive epistemic injustice
   - Irzik and Kurtulmu≈ü's framework
   - Applies framework: parachute science fails to meet requirements
      - Failure to produce necessary knowledge for citizens
      - Failure to produce knowledge for effective pursuit of justice
      - Willful creation of ignorance
      - Neglect of social groups and weighty interests
= Conclusion: Steps Toward Meaningful Change
   - Critiques inadequate ethics statements (I. challengeri case)
   - Proposes steps for developing collaborative relationships:
      - Mutual transparency and trust
      - Honest communication about research ramifications
      - Borrowing from literature on indigenous collaboration
   - Instituitional responsibility in oversea research
   -  Broader applicability of harm taxonomy
   - Reaffirmation: parachute science as *distributive epistemic injustice*

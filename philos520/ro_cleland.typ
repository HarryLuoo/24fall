== Introduction
- *Scope*: Historical research plays a crucial role in natural sciences.
- *Philosophical Focus*: Despite significant scientific achievements, philosophical discussions have largely overlooked historical natural sciences, except for evolutionary biology.
- *Methodological Distinction*: Building on Cleland’s work (2001, 2002), the essay differentiates "prototypical historical science," which investigates unique, long-past events, from "classical experimental science," which examines regular patterns among event types.
- *Essay Focus*: explanation and justification in historical natural science, arguing that confirmation relies more on the explanatory success of hypotheses rather than their predictive accuracy.

*II. Methodology of Historical Natural Science*
- *Two Stages*:
  1. *Hypothesis Proliferation*: Scientists develop multiple competing hypotheses to explain puzzling evidence gathered from fieldwork.
  2. *Smoking Gun Search*: decisive evidence that clearly supports one hypothesis over the others.
- *Epistemic Context*: Findings in historical science are provisional and can be revised with new evidence or theoretical advancements.
- *Role of Technology*: Technological innovations are often essential for detecting and analyzing subtle or degraded traces, facilitating breakthroughs.
- *Complementarity*: The two methodological stages complement each other and are not in conflict.

*III. Justification in Historical Natural Science*
- *Primacy of Explanation*: Explanatory power is more important than predictive capabilities in evaluating historical hypotheses.
- *Limitations of Prediction*: Predictions in historical science tend to be vague and not decisive; failed predictions rarely lead to hypothesis rejection, while successful predictions are not always necessary for acceptance.
- *Common Cause Explanation*: Central to justification, narrative explanations in historical science rely on common causes for empirical support.
- *Response to Critics*: Turner and Jeffares : the role of prediction in historical science.

*IV. Common Cause and Asymmetry of Overdetermination*
- *Justification Basis*: The principle of common cause is supported by the asymmetry of overdetermination, where past events typically cause multiple diverse effects, unlike future events.
- *Empirical Foundation*: This asymmetry is grounded in physical principles.
- *Scientific Preference*: Scientists naturally prefer common cause explanations due to the overdetermination asymmetry.
- *Information Dynamics*: Technological advances mitigate concerns about information degradation, allowing for better evidence extraction.

*V. Case Studies*
- *Examples*: End-Cretaceous extinction and the Alvarez hypothesis, Snowball Earth, Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), and End-Permian extinctions.
- *Purpose*: These cases illustrate the methodology and justification processes in historical science.

*VI. Philosophical Implications*
- *Defense of Common Cause*: The essay addresses and counters critiques by philosophers like Sober and Tucker.
- *Role of Background Theories*: Background theories, such as Darwin’s evolution theory, influence the preference for common cause explanations over separate causes.

*VII. Conclusion*
- *Distinct Methodology*: Emphasizes that historical science prioritizes explaining traces rather than making predictions.
- *Empirical Foundation and Preference*: Based on the asymmetry of overdetermination, supporting a default preference for common causes.
- *Epistemic Equality*: Argues that historical sciences are epistemically comparable to, and may even surpass, experimental sciences in certain aspects.

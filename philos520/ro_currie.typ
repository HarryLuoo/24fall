== Currie, Chpt 9. Introduction:
- The essay argues against the view that historical scientists cannot generate their own evidence and are limited to passive observation
- It challenges the idea that historical scientists are "stuck with what nature provides" in terms of evidence
- The author will argue that historical scientists can manufacture "smoking guns" (key pieces of evidence) through controlled manipulations

== Background on "smoking guns":
- Carol Cleland's concept of a "smoking gun" is clarified
- A smoking gun is not necessarily a decisive critical test, but rather a piece of evidence that shifts investigations in a particular direction when combined with other evidence
- Cleland sees historical scientists as searching for evidence while experimentalists generate it

== Case study: Modeling ancient echinoderm development
- Zachos and Sprinkle created a computer model of echinoderm development to study differences between ancient (stem group) and modern (crown group) echinoderms
- The model suggested stem group echinoderms may have developed similarly to modern ones, just with more insertion points for new plates (relaxed "Ocular Plate Rule")
- This challenges the view that stem and crown group echinoderms had radically different developmental systems

== Argument that the model results can count as evidence:
- The author uses the law of likelihood to argue the model results can count as evidence favoring one hypothesis over another
- Key is establishing a probabilistic link between the model results and the hypotheses about ancient echinoderm development
- The model's validity for modern echinoderms, plus phylogenetic relationships, allows it to serve as a proxy for manipulating ancient echinoderms

== Addressing objections:
-  Models only generate hypotheses, not evidence
- Countered by noting the model produced surprising results and is treated as evidential by the researchers

-  Models only mediate between theory and data 
- Countered by noting this model doesn't draw out consequences of a mathematical theory, but represents developmental systems directly

-  Models rarely provide evidence in practice
- Author acknowledges challenges but argues validation practices and holistic assessment can often establish evidential relevance

== Conclusion:
- Historical scientists can generate evidence by constructing and manipulating models/surrogates
- This undermines pessimism about historical sciences' epistemic capabilities
- Next chapter will further explore use of models as "surrogate experiments" in historical science

// The essay's structure moves from introducing the issue, to presenting a case study, to making an argument that the case study counts as evidence generation, to addressing potential objections to that argument. The core claim is that historical scientists are not limited to passive observation but can actively generate evidence through modeling and simulation.

== Currie, Chpt 10.  Introduction
   -  Idealization as a prevalent and puzzling feature in science. Examples:
      - Newton treating the moon and Earth as a two-body system
      - Zachos and Sprinkle treating three-dimensional sea urchins as two-dimensional geometric shapes
      - Population geneticists treating finite populations as infinite
   -  Three main aims for the chapter:
      - Connect: the discussion of surrogates in historical science to the broader literature on modeling and idealization
      - Argue: the purpose of idealizations in historical science is often to facilitate testing by ensuring information is provided at the right grain
      - Introduce: the concept of investigative scaffolding and its importance in historical science

== Simulations and Surrogate Experiments
    -  The author provides Parker's (2009) definition of simulation and discusses its implications.
    -  A detailed example of Hyde et al.'s study of Snowball Earth is presented:
       - The ice-sheet model is explained, which predicts ice extent
       - The energy balance model (EBM) is described, which outputs global and equatorial temperature
       - The author goes into detail about the equations and variables involved in these models, providing a taste of their complexity
    -  Hyde et al.'s "experiments" with the simulation are described:
       - They tested the sensitivity of ice-sheet extent to different levels of CO2 atmospheric concentration
       - They investigated the relationship between CO2 and continental freeboard
       - They tested the occurrence of snowballs against different continental arrangements

== Surrogate "Experiments"
     -  The author compares procedural and substantive accounts of experiments:
        - Procedural accounts define experiments as interventions on a system
        - Substantive accounts focus on the epistemic power of experimentation
     -  The concept of "surrogate experiments" is introduced:
        - These are controlled investigations of surrogates, not specimens
        - They differ from true experiments in that the object and target are different kinds of things
     -  The advantages of surrogate experiments in historical science are discussed, particularly their ability to actively generate new knowledge about the past

== The Purpose of Idealization
    -  Weisberg's framework for understanding idealization's purposes is presented:
       - Tractability: Idealization helps manage complexity and compensate for limited knowledge
       - Explanatory salience: Idealization can isolate the most relevant causal factors
       - Conflicting desiderata: Idealization can help navigate tensions between different scientific goals
    -  The author introduces a new purpose: facilitating testing at the right grain for evidential relevance
    -  A case study of Wilkinson et al.'s sauropod methane hypothesis is examined:
       - The inference tool used to estimate sauropod population and methane output is described
       - Van Loon's objections to the tool are discussed, highlighting issues with its level of idealization

== Investigative Scaffolding
   -  The author defines and explains investigative scaffolding as a process where coarse-grained hypotheses must be established before finer-grained ones can be teste- 
   -  Examples from Snowball Earth research are provided to illustrate scaffolding:
      - The reevaluation of trace evidence led to more complex hypotheses about atmospheric composition
      - Consideration of the relationship between Snowball Earth and the Cambrian explosion motivated new simulations and hypotheses
   -  An abstract characterization of scaffolded investigation is presented, emphasizing the relationship between coarse-grained and fine-grained hypotheses
   -  The role of idealization in scaffolding is explored:
      - Idealization helps in getting the grain right for hypothesis testing
      - De-idealization often occurs when scaffolds are reached and more fine-grained evidence is needed

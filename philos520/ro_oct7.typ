=== *Abstract*
- *Main Thesis*: Traditional philosophical analyses focused on trace-based reasoning in paleosciences inadequately capture the essential role of modeling.
- *Key Points*:
  - Models inform both actual history and possible scenarios.
  - Phenomena-driven modeling ensures relevance by aligning closely with historical data.
  - Emphasizes that historical sciences rely on understanding possibilities (modality) alongside actual events.
=== *1. Introduction*
- *Context*: Paleoscientists face epistemic scarcity due to extensive temporal scales and information decay.
- *Argument*: Current philosophical accounts prioritize trace-based reasoning but overlook the pervasive use of models.
- *Objective*: Highlight the critical role of models in understanding the deep past, focusing on their ability to explore possibilities.
=== *2. Models & Traces*
==== *2.1. Trace-Based Reasoning*
- *Definition*: Inferring past events from traces (fossils, tracks) using theories of trace formation.
- *Philosophical Accounts*:
  - *Carol Cleland*: Emphasizes "smoking gun" reasoning—correlations, hypothesis generation, and trace discrimination.
  - *Derek Turner*: Argues historical knowledge is underdetermined due to trace decay and lack of intervention capabilities.
- *Critique*: Trace-based reasoning alone doesn't account for the extensive use of modeling in paleosciences.
==== *2.2. Modelling as Strategy*
- *Philosophical Perspectives*:
  - *Weisberg & Godfrey-Smith*: Models as indirect strategies to understand target systems through proxies.
- *Case Study*: 
  - *MBL Model*: Stochastic branching model used to identify macroevolutionary patterns beyond randomness.
- *Contrast*: Traditional modeling is more abstract, whereas paleoscientific modeling is often closely tied to empirical data.

=== *2.3. Philosophy of Paleoscientific Modeling*
- *Applications*:
  - *Functional Morphology*: Simulations to infer locomotion of extinct species.
  - *Archaeology*: Models to interpret cultural patterns and integrate legacy data.
  - *Paleoclimatology*: Computational models to reconstruct climatic history.
- *Philosophical Insights*: Models act as epistemic tools that correct, refine, and integrate data, bridging actual and possible historical scenarios.

=== *3. Two Models of the Deep Past*
=== *3.1. Dinosaur Tails*
- *Study*: Ibrahim et al. (2020) tested propulsion efficiency of Spinosaurus' tail using physical models.
- *Findings*: Spinosaurus' tail generated significantly more thrust, supporting its adaptation for aquatic pursuit.
- *Philosophical Implication*: Demonstrates models testing capacity hypotheses, establishing possibilities about extinct species’ behaviors.

=== *3.2. Avalonian Ecological Communities*
- *Study*: Mitchell et al. (2019) used Spatial Point Process Analysis (SPPA) to analyze Ediacaran taxa distribution.
- *Findings*: Avalonian communities were predominantly structured by neutral (stochastic) processes, differing from modern niche-structured ecosystems.
- *Philosophical Implication*: Illustrates phenomena-driven modeling, ensuring models are directly informed by empirical data to explore specific historical phenomena.

=== *4. Modality & Modeling in Historical Science*
=== *4.1. Possible Pasts*
- *Argument*: Historical sciences require understanding possibilities to reconstruct the past.
- *Role of Models*: Explore capacity hypotheses and regularities, complementing trace-based reasoning.

=== *4.2. Phenomena-Driven Modeling*
- *Definition*: Models are iteratively refined based on empirical phenomena, ensuring relevance.
- *Contrast with Theory-Driven*: Emphasizes direct alignment with data rather than exploring abstract theories.
- *Benefits*: Enhances model relevance and epistemic robustness by grounding possibilities in empirical evidence.

=== *5. Conclusion*
- *Summary*: Models are indispensable for both inferring actual events and exploring possible scenarios in historical sciences.
- *Phenomena-Driven Approach*: Ensures models are tightly integrated with empirical data, enhancing their explanatory power.
- *Philosophical Implications*: Calls for expanded philosophical frameworks that recognize the nuanced role of modeling alongside trace-based reasoning in historical sciences.

=== 1. Introduction
- *Philosophical Gap*: Highlights the lack of focus on data models in the philosophy of science.
- *Objective*: Examines how paleontologists construct and correct paleodiversity data models from fossil records.
- *Key Theses*:
  - Fidelity, not purity, determines epistemic reliability.
  - Fidelity is gradual and can be enhanced through model-based corrections.
  - Data models should be assessed based on their adequacy for specific purposes.

==== 2. Historical Context of Paleodiversity Data
- *Early Recognition of Biases*:
  - Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin identified biases and incompleteness in the fossil record.
  - Darwin’s concerns about gaps undermining evolutionary theory.
- *Paleobiological Revolution*:
  - 1970s shift towards quantitative methods and computer simulations in paleontology.
  - Jack Sepkoski’s contributions, including the Sepkoski curve and large fossil databases.
- *Approaches to Reading the Fossil Record*:
  - Optimistic (literal) reading vs. corrected (generalized) approaches using models.

==== 3. Contemporary Methods for Correcting Paleodiversity Data
- *Subsampling Approaches*:
  - *Classical Rarefaction*: Assumes uniform sample sizes; identified as inadequate by Alroy.
  - *Shareholder Quorum Subsampling (SQS)*: Tracks data coverage, improving on classical methods.
- *Residuals Approaches*:
  - Separates biological signals from geological biases by modeling and subtracting bias effects.
  - Tested through simulations showing improved accuracy over raw data.
- *Phylogenetic Approaches*:
  - Uses cladistic analysis to infer and fill gaps (ghost lineages, Lazarus taxa).
  - Reliability assessed via simulations, showing generally better performance than raw data.

==== 4. Philosophical Implications: Fidelity and Adequacy-for-Purpose
- *Purity vs. Fidelity*:
  - Purity (unprocessed data) is less important than fidelity (accuracy in representing the signal).
- *Fidelity as a Degree*:
  - Data models vary in how well they capture the relevant biological signal.
- *Vicarious Control*:
  - Models improve data fidelity post-collection by correcting distortions and noise.
- *Adequacy-for-Purpose*:
  - Data models must be evaluated based on their suitability for specific scientific hypotheses and purposes.

==== 5. Data Models Across Hierarchical Levels
- *Prepared Fossil Specimens*:
  - Fossil preparation involves model-based decisions to enhance data utility.
  - Preparators distinguish between signal and noise based on theoretical needs.
- *Model-Data Symbiosis*:
  - Models and data are mutually dependent, enhancing each other’s scientific utility.
  - Emphasizes the iterative nature of improving data through modeling.

==== 6. Conclusion
- *Summary of Philosophical Themes*:
  - Fidelity over purity, incremental improvement of data, vicarious control, and adequacy-for-purpose.
- *Significance of Model-Based Corrections*:
  - Demonstrates how models enhance the reliability and utility of paleodiversity data.
- *Broader Insights*:
  - Provides a framework for understanding data models' role and evaluation in scientific practice.
- *Final Thoughts*:
  - Highlights the ingenuity of scientists in addressing data incompleteness and bias through sophisticated modeling techniques.

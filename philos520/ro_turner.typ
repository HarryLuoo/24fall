== * Asymmetries*
- *Introduction to Epistemic Asymmetry*
  - Defines "prehistory" and focuses on paleontology and geology.
  - Introduces epistemic asymmetry: more knowledge of the tiny (microphysical) than the past.
  - Highlights importance for philosophers, scientists, and others.

== *Limits to Our Knowledge of Prehistory*
- *Example of Sauropod Trackways*
  - Differentiates wide-gauge and narrow-gauge tracks.
  - Explores hypotheses: same species, substrate, different species.
  - *Wilson and Carrano (1999) Biomechanical Analysis*
    - Titanosaurs likely made wide-gauge tracks; femur morphology supports this.
  - *Speculation on Titanosaur Locomotion*
    - Semi-bipedal hypothesis is speculative.
  - *Conclusion*: Transition from solid science to speculation in historical sciences.

== *The Time Asymmetry of Knowledge*
- *Introduction to Time Asymmetry*
  - More knowledge of the past than the future.
  - *Paul Horwich's Explanation*
    - Recording systems provide past information; precording systems for future do not exist.
    - *Fork Asymmetry*: Correlated events have common causes, not common effects.
  - *Implications*: Explains extensive past records and limited future knowledge.

== *The Past vs. the Microphysical*
- *Introduction to Epistemic Scope Asymmetry*
  - Contrasts knowledge of the past with the microphysical.
- *Asymmetry of Manipulability*
  - *Ian Hacking*: Scientists can manipulate microphysical entities, aiding theory testing.
- *Role Asymmetry of Background Theories*
  - *Dampening Role*: Historical theories limit evidence (e.g., taphonomy).
  - *Enlarging Role*: Microphysical theories create new evidence (e.g., optics).
  - *Conclusion*: Asymmetries create an epistemic asymmetry favoring the microphysical.

== *Scientific Realism*
- *Overview of Scientific Realism*
  - Realists believe scientific theories describe both observable and unobservable aspects.
- *Epistemological Optimism*
  - *Boyd, Psillos, McMullin, Leplin, Devitt*: Knowledge of unobservables is possible and actual.
- *Critiques and Alternatives*
  - *Social Constructivists and Arthur Fine's NOA*: Share optimism but differ on metaphysical claims.
- *Skeptical Arguments*
  - *Pessimistic Induction*: Past scientific beliefs about unobservables often discarded.
  - *Underdetermination*: Observable evidence insufficient for unique truths about unobservables.
- *Realists' Defense*
  - *Inference to the Best Explanation*: Success of theories implies their approximate truth.

== *A Skewed Debate*
- *Fictional Analogy*
  - Investigators study two kinds of unobservables (K and K\*).
  - Philosophers focus on K, neglecting K\*.
- *Epistemic Differences*
  - *Genus/Species Confusion*: Overgeneralizing from K to all unobservables.
  - *High-Level Generality*: Debate at genus level misses species-specific challenges.
- *Parallel to Realism Debate*
  - Realists focus on microphysical (K), neglecting historical (K\*).
  - *Consequences: *Overlooks epistemic asymmetries, leading to incomplete conclusions.

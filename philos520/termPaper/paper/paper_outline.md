# The Principle of Simplicity: From Dogmatic Acceptance to Justified Practice

## 1. Introduction

Overview: The paper traces how simplicity principles evolved from dogmatic assumptions to justified methodological tools, using uniformitarianism as a central case study. We argue that while simplicity remains valuable in scientific practice, its application requires explicit justification and recognition of complexity.

### A. The Problem of Justification

High-level summary: Scientific practice frequently invokes simplicity as a guiding principle, yet its justification often remains implicit or is taken as self-evident. This raises questions about the nature and validity of such justifications.

- Opening example: Use of simplicity in theory selection
  * Historical prevalence in science
  * Current methodological role
  * Reference: Sober (2015, Ch.1) for overview of simplicity in science

- Tension between acceptance and justification
  * Widespread use in practice
  * Lack of explicit justification
  * Reference: Mitchell (2009, Ch.2) on complexity vs simplification

- Contemporary challenges
  * Recognition of complex systems
  * Need for nuanced approaches
  * Reference: Mitchell (2009, Ch.4) on limitations of simple models

### B. Thesis Statement

This paper examines whether the widespread acceptance of simplicity as a methodological principle in science has been adequately justified or has occasionally lapsed into dogmatic practice. Through analyzing historical justifications of simplicity and examining the development of uniformitarianism as a case study, we argue that while simplicity principles have valid applications when properly justified, their acceptance as default assumptions without explicit justification risks dogmatic application.

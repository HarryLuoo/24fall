Is science really a religion? Specifically, to what extent does the scientific community treat foundational assumptions, such as the consistency of natural laws, as unquestionable beliefs akin to religious dogmas, and how does the historical evolution of these assumptions reveal inherent self-correcting mechanisms that differentiate science from religion?

This term paper investigates whether science functions similarly to a religion by examining the epistemological foundations of two pivotal geological theories: uniformitarianism and catastrophism. It explores how the scientific community treats the assumption of consistent natural laws as foundational premises, akin to religious dogmas, especially under the pressure of ongoing scientific development. By analyzing the historical debates and eventual synthesis of these theories, the paper highlights the self-correcting nature of science, contrasting it with the static nature of religious beliefs. The study aims to elucidate the similarities in foundational assumptions while underscoring the inherent differences in adaptability and justification methods between scientific and religious epistemologies.
